## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a modern character encounters a folklore being who is struggling with its own outdated, gendered role.
- Describe a 'liminal space' in your own environment (an alley, a waiting room) and how it might 'shimmer' for a character in emotional flux.
- Create a new 'Partial Person'—a being of unresolved identity—and the unique metaphysical effect their presence causes.
- Draft a letter from Professor Finch to another academic, obliquely warning them about a different unstable symbolic location.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Shimmer Generator'—a visual web tool that applies glitch, overlay, and sound effects to an image to suggest a liminal, perceiving space.
- Create an interactive map of 'Unstable Thresholds' using the novel's concepts, allowing users to add their own locations with descriptions and symbolic tags.
