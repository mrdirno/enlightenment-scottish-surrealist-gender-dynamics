  "cover_prompt": "A spectral scholar, their form shimmering and indistinct, laboriously adjusts a large-format camera on a tripod, aiming it not at the physical landscape but at the shimmering, fractured air above a peat-dark Scottish ford, where half-formed figures of light and shadow wade in a state of perpetual becoming, their genders fluid and unresolved. The scene is a haunted river crossing at twilight, with ancient standing stones covered in luminous lichen lining the bank, and the water itself reflecting not the sky but a swirling, ethereal nebula of conflicting hues, capturing the metaphysical crisis of dissolution. In the atmospheric style of a surrealist like Leonora Carrington blended with the eerie, folkloric sensibility of Scottish painter John Duncan, evoking mystical transformation and symbolic depth. Book cover framing, centered composition with the scholar and their camera as the focal point, viewed from a low, dramatic angle that emphasizes the towering, unstable figures in the ford. Cinematic lighting with a clash of cold, misty moonlight and warm, unnatural phosphorescence from the water, using a palette of deep peat browns, murky greens, ethereal violets, and flashes of unsettling gold. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
