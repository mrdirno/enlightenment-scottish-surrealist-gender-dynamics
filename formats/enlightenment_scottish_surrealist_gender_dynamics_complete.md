# Chapter 1

## **CHAPTER 1**

The whisky was a peat-bog ghost, haunting the glass. Isla MacLeod held it up to the weak Glasgow light bleeding through the pub window, watching the amber liquid cling to the sides like a confession. It was ten in the morning. The pub, *The Hanged Man*, smelled of last night’s spilled lager and this morning’s despair, a perfume she was coming to know intimately.

“He’s late,” she said, to no one.

“He’s a concept, hen,” Morag replied from behind the bar, polishing a pint glass with a cloth that had seen more battles than the standard at Culloden. “Concepts are never late. They just are, or they aren’t.” Morag was seventy if she was a day, her hair a vibrant, improbable aubergine, her arms a roadmap of faded blue tattoos. She ran *The Hanged Man* with the serene brutality of a pirate queen overseeing a derelict ship.

Isla’s concept was Professor Alistair Finch. Emeritus Chair of Comparative Metaphysics, University of Glasgow. Author of *The Architecture of Unseen Bridges: A Treatise on Interstitial Realities*. He had written her a letter on thick, cream paper that felt like pressed bone. *Your thesis on the gendered cartography of liminal spaces in Scottish folklore shows a… disturbing acuity,* it read. *Disturbing, because it hints at doors better left painted shut. Come and discuss. Bring a bottle of something that tastes of earth and endings.*

So here she was, with a bottle of 25-year-old Laphroaig, in a pub that felt like the waiting room for a ferry no one wanted to board.

The door groaned open, admitting not a man, but a disturbance in the air. A tweed overcoat that seemed to be consuming its wearer, a shock of white hair like arctic moss, and eyes the colour of a winter sea under a storm. He paused, sniffed the air as if tasting its composition, and beelined for her table.

“You have the peat,” he stated, his voice a dry rustle of pages. “Good. The cheap stuff is for tourists and the spiritually bankrupt.” He slid into the booth opposite her, shedding his coat to reveal a cardigan of such profound, cable-knotted complexity it could have been a topological map of a nervous breakdown. “Isla MacLeod. You look less like a vandal than I’d feared.”

“A vandal, Professor?”

“Of boundaries, lass. You’re poking at the mortar between worlds with your feminist critique. Dangerous masonry. It can fall on you.” He produced two crystal tumblers from a leather satchel, placing them on the sticky table with ceremonial care. “Pour.”

She did. The whisky released its smoky breath into the space between them.

Finch took a sip, closed his eyes, and shuddered. “Aye. That’s the stuff. The memory of drowned forests. Now. Your paper. The *Bean Nighe*.”

The washerwoman. The omen of death, seen at fords, cleaning the blood-stained clothes of those about to die.

“You posit,” he continued, “that she is not merely a harbinger, but a *custodian*. That the ford, the *linne*, is not just a geographical threshold, but a gendered one. A space where the work of women—cleaning, grieving, preparing the body—bleeds into the metaphysical. That her weeping is a solvent, washing away the boundary between this life and the next.”

“It’s an interpretation,” Isla said, her own whisky untouched.

“It’s a bloody crowbar,” he corrected, opening his eyes. They were alarmingly bright. “And you used it to jimmy open a window I’ve spent forty years trying to keep locked. Tell me, have you ever *seen* a liminal space… shimmer?”

The question was so absurd she almost laughed. But his face was granite. “Shimmer?”

“Aye. A visual stutter. A place that looks back. Most people, their minds just skate over it. They see a misty glen, an old doorway, a stretch of river, and think ‘pretty’ or ‘dull’. But sometimes, for some people, the veil is thinner. The mind’s eye gets a splinter of the real picture. Women, often. The perpetually grieving, the furious, the ones who listen to the silence until it starts to hum.”

Isla thought of the standing stone on the moor near her grandmother’s house. How, as a child, she’d sometimes see it not as grey, but as a deep, vibrating indigo, like a thumb pressed against a closed eyelid. She’d told her mother, who’d called it a migraine coming on.

“Suppose I have,” she said carefully.

Finch leaned forward, his scent a blend of mothballs, old books, and that profound whisky. “The world is a layer cake, Miss MacLeod. Geology, biology, history, society. All sensible strata. But between the layers… there’s the icing. The sticky, irrational, *symbolic* filling. Most cultures learn to ignore it. We Scots, we’re cursed with a sweet tooth for it. We built our national identity on the stuff. And it’s thickest here. In the thresholds. The doorways. The fords. The moments between sleeping and waking.”

He drained his glass. “There’s a place. A *linne*. Not on any modern map. It’s in a valley north of Glencoe. The locals, what few are left, call it *Linne nan Daoine Sgàthach*.”

“The Ford of the Shadow People.”

“A poetical translation. More accurately, The Ford of the *Partial* People. The Unfinished. The Maybe-Men and Perhaps-Women.” He fixed her with his storm-sea gaze. “I believe it’s a nexus. A place where the symbolic filling of the world has… congealed. Become semi-permeable. I believe your *Bean Nighe* doesn’t just work there. She *guards* it. And I believe the guard is changing.”

Isla felt a cool finger trace her spine. “Changing how?”

“The old stories are gendered because the old world was. The woman weeps by the water. The man is the one who dies. But what happens, Miss MacLeod, when the symbols get… confused? When the roles won’t stick? What comes to wash the clothes then?” He pushed a folded, yellowed piece of vellum across the table. It was a hand-drawn map, all frantic lines and archaic notations. In the centre, a ford was marked not with an X, but with a small, intricate symbol: a circle divided by a wavy line, one half stippled, the other blank.

“What is that symbol?”

“It’s not a symbol. It’s a question.” He tapped it with a bony finger. “*An e fir no boireannach a th’ ann?* Is it male or female that is in it? That’s the question the ford is asking now. And the answer is… both. And neither. And it’s causing a traffic jam in the metaphysics.”

Isla finally took a drink. The whisky was a fire that burned clean, cutting through the surreal fog of his words. “Why are you telling me this? I’m a postgraduate with a thesis and a mountain of debt, not a… a metaphysician.”

“Because you *see* the shimmer,” he said simply. “And because you think in terms of custodians, not monsters. And because I’m too old and too tired to go. My bones would turn to chalk in a place that uncertain. But you… you’re unfinished yourself, aren’t you? A maybe-woman in a world that demands a certainly.”

It was a brutal, perfect insight. Isla felt it land in her gut. The unfinished thesis, the relationships that dissolved like sugar in rain, the constant sense of being a rough draft of a person.

“What would I do? Take a water sample?”

Finch’s laugh was a short, dry bark. “Observe. Document. Use that crowbar mind of yours. Take this.” He slid a small, cloth-wrapped bundle from his satchel. Unwrapped, it was a camera. An old Rolleiflex, twin lenses like insect eyes. “It uses film. Slow. Deliberate. The digital stuff is too certain, too full of ones and zeroes. This… this captures ghosts better. The light that was, not the light that is.”

“You want me to photograph a superstition.”

“I want you to photograph the question,” he corrected. “The map is your guide. The whisky is for courage. The camera is for proof. For yourself, if no one else.”

“And what’s in it for you?”

“The satisfaction of a retired man who has passed on a particularly vexing puzzle.” He stood, pulling his consuming overcoat back on. “The ford is most active at the cusp seasons. The turn from spring to summer. The *Bealltainn* threshold. You have three weeks. Don’t dally. And Isla?”

She looked up.

“If you see the washerwoman… mind her tears. They’re not just salt and water. They’re the solvent.”

He left then, a disturbance exiting, leaving the air in the pub feeling flat and stale. Morag ambled over, collecting the empty glasses. “Told you. A concept. Did he pay his tab?”

“He didn’t order anything.”

“Aye, but he occupied the space. That’s a penny a minute.” She looked at the map and the camera on the table. “Off to find the maybe-folk, are you?”

“You heard?”

“I hear most things that matter. The rest is just noise.” She wiped the table with a final, decisive swipe. “Take salt. And a knife that’s tasted your own blood. Not for fighting. For remembering what side of the skin you’re on.”

Isla packed the camera and the map into her bag. The weight of them felt absurd. She was a scholar, not an adventurer. Yet, underneath the academic’s scepticism, a deeper, older part of her was stirring. The part that had seen the standing stone shimmer. The part that wrote about weeping women at fords not as folklore, but as fractured truth.

She left *The Hanged Man*, stepping out into the Glasgow drizzle. The city was all solid stone and rushing certainty. Cars, schedules, concrete. But in her bag, a piece of vellum whispered of a place where solid things turned soft, where questions took up space, and where the work of women might be the only thing holding the layers of the world apart.

She didn’t go home. She went to the university library, to the dusty back shelves where they kept the parish records and the unsorted folklore collections. She needed to know what, if anything, lay behind the professor’s madness. She pulled down a volume of 19th-century Highland surveys, its leather spine cracking in protest.

Hours later, her eyes gritty, she found it. A passing mention in a minister’s journal from 1823. *Came upon the valley they call the Sgàthach. A queer, close air. Met a solitary figure by the stream, neither plainly man nor woman, who spoke in riddles of ‘the wash that never ends’. Gave me a profound unease, as if I had looked upon my own soul and found it unfinished.* The minister had drawn a shaky little sketch in the margin. It was the same symbol from Finch’s map.

The cool finger on her spine became a hand, gripping.

Her phone buzzed. A text from her thesis supervisor. *Isla. Progress report? The committee is asking about your field research chapter. We need something tangible.*

She looked at the ancient book, at the minister’s terrified scrawl. She looked at her bag holding the camera and the map.

*Something tangible.*

She texted back: *Beginning field research tomorrow. Remote location. May be out of touch for a week or two. Following a lead on custodial figures in liminal spaces.*

The reply was almost immediate. *Custodial figures? Isla, this needs to be academically rigorous, not a ghost hunt. Keep it grounded.*

Too late, she thought. The ground was already shifting.

She left the library as it closed, the dusk settling over Glasgow like a damp shroud. In her flat, she packed a rucksack with practical things: boots, waterproofs, a sleeping bag, a torch. And then the impractical: the salt, a small pocket knife from her kitchen. She pricked her thumb, a bright bead of blood welling up. She smeared it on the knife’s blade. *For remembering what side of the skin you’re on.*

Lastly, she loaded film into the Rolleiflex, the mechanism smooth and heavy. She looked through the viewfinder, the world appearing upside down and reversed. A disorienting, truthful perspective.

That night, she dreamed of a river. The water was the colour of slate and milk. On the far bank, a figure knelt, scrubbing at a pile of cloth that leaked a colour darker than black. The figure’s shoulders shook with sobs, but when it turned its head, the face was a smooth, blank oval, like an egg. From it came a voice that was both deep and high, a chord of grief. It said, “The basket is full. Who will carry the load?”

Isla woke at 4 a.m., her cheeks wet. She hadn’t wept in years. The room felt different. The shadows in the corner were not just absences of light, but presences of something else. She could almost see them… shimmer.

She got up, made tea, and watched the night fade. When the first grey light touched the tenements across the street, she shouldered her pack. She touched the camera, a hard, real shape under the cloth.

The concept had been planted. The maybe-woman was going to the Ford of the Maybe-People.

She locked her flat, a definitive click in the quiet hall. She was not certain of what she was doing. But she was, for the first time in a long time, in motion.

# Chapter 2

## **CHAPTER 2**

The train north was a worm of stale air and soft complaint. Isla watched the central belt’s urban clutter give way to the green ache of the Highlands. The map lay open on the tiny table, Finch’s frantic lines superimposed over the calm, authoritative greens and yellows of the Ordnance Survey. His ford was a ghost in the grid, a whisper in the contour lines. It existed in a blank space between two named lochs, a place the mapmakers had deemed unworthy of note.

A man in a cycling jersey sat opposite, his knees almost touching hers. He’d been trying to catch her eye since Perth.

“Walking holiday?” he asked, his voice too loud for the carriage.

“Research,” she said, not looking up.

“Ah! Biologist? Geologist?”

“Folklorist.”

His smile faltered, reconfigured into something patronising. “Ghosts and ghoulies, eh? Good luck with that.” He returned to his phone, the conversation deemed unproductive.

Isla traced the route with her finger. The train would take her as far as a village called Invermaire. From there, it was a fifteen-mile hike into a glen that, according to the library’s geology survey, was a glacial cul-de-sac, a place the ice had scooped out and forgotten.

She took out the Rolleiflex, feeling its weight in her hands. She aimed it out the window at a blur of heather-clad hillside, not to take a picture, but to see the world through its eyes. In the viewfinder, the rushing landscape was a silent, inverted ballet. It felt more real, somehow. Less cluttered with meaning.

At Invermaire, the station was a single platform and a rusting sign. The air was cold and clean, scoured by wind that smelled of pine and distant rain. The village was a clutch of whitewashed houses, a closed post office, and a pub called *The Stag’s Head*. It was the kind of place that seemed to be holding its breath.

She needed supplies. The pub was the only obvious source.

Inside, it was dark, the air peat-sweet from a smouldering fire. A few old men sat at the bar, their conversation a low murmur like river stones. They fell silent when she entered. The barman, a broad man with a beard that seemed to be devouring his lower face, nodded.

“Aye?”

“I’m after some things. Tinned food. Matches. Maybe a gas canister for a camp stove.”

He looked her up and down, her city jeans, her technical rucksack. “Walking?”

“Yes. Up towards Glen Sgàthach.”

The silence in the room thickened. One of the old men turned slowly on his stool. He had eyes the colour of old whisky, milky at the edges. “There’s nothing for you up that glen, lass.”

“Scenery,” she said, her voice sounding brittle to her own ears.

“Scenery,” the old man repeated, as if the word was a foreign currency of dubious value. “Aye. It’s scenic enough. It’s also… *faoin*.”

“Faoin?”

“Futile. Empty. A place that leads nowhere.” He took a slow sip of his pint. “The path’s gone. Sheep took it years ago. You’ll be climbing over bracken and bog. And the midges… they’ll eat you alive.”

“I’ll manage.”

The barman shrugged, a massive movement of shoulders. “I’ve got tins. No gas. You’d need to go back to Fort William for that.”

She bought what he had: tinned stew, beans, a box of damp matches. As he bagged them, he spoke without looking at her. “You’ll see a bothy. A shepherd’s hut. By the lochan at the head of the glen. Roof’s half gone. But it’s stone. It’ll keep the worst of the weather off. Better than a tent in that place.”

“Thank you.”

He met her eyes then. “If you hear singing by the water… don’t answer it. It’s not asking for you.”

A chill, separate from the damp of the pub, touched her. “What kind of singing?”

But he had turned away, wiping the bar with a cloth. The conversation was over.

The old man watched her leave, his milky eyes unreadable.

The track out of the village was a muddy rut between drystone dykes. It climbed steadily, and within an hour, Invermaire was a smudge of white in the valley below, and the silence was complete. It was not a peaceful quiet. It was an attentive one. The wind hushed through the grass. A grouse clattered out of the heather, making her heart slam against her ribs. Her boots were already soaked from crossing a dozen seeping burns.

Finch’s map was infuriatingly vague. It relied on landmarks that might have changed in two centuries: a split rock, a rowan tree struck by lightning, a bend in the river where the water ran “backwards over its own reflection”. She found the split rock, a giant slab of granite riven down the middle as if by a giant’s axe. It felt ominous, a doorway to nothing.

By late afternoon, the weather turned. A mist, fine and cold, descended from the higher peaks, blurring the world into shades of grey. The path, as predicted, vanished into a slope of tussocky grass and hidden holes. Her progress slowed to a clumsy, exhausting slog. The rucksack, which had felt manageable in the station, now seemed filled with lead weights and regret.

And the midges found her. A cloud of tiny, insistent agony, swarming her face, her ears, getting into her eyes and mouth. She smeared on repellent, but it was like trying to hold back the sea with a sponge. She pulled up her hood, tied a buff over her face, and stumbled on, a miserable, anonymous creature in the fog.

Just as the light was beginning to fail, the ground levelled. The mist thinned for a moment, and she saw it. A small, dark lochan, its surface like polished lead. And beside it, a low, rectangular shape: the bothy.

It was more ruin than shelter. One whole corner of the roof had collapsed, and the door was a rotten plank hanging from one hinge. But it was stone, and it had four walls. She pushed inside. The floor was dirt and old sheep droppings. The air was cold and smelled of decay and wet wool. But it was a refuge.

She cleared a space by the intact wall, using a piece of the fallen roof to sweep away the worst of the detritus. She was too tired to light the camp stove, too tired to eat. She drank some water, wrapped herself in her sleeping bag, and leaned against the cold stone. The mist pressed against the empty window hole, a swirling, silent white.

This was folly. Academic suicide. She was sitting in a ruined hut, being eaten by insects, chasing a senile professor’s delusion for a thesis chapter that would be laughed out of the examination room. She thought of her flat, her books, the electric kettle, the certain, solid world of footnotes and bibliographies.

A sound cut through the self-pity.

It was faint, carried on the damp air. Not singing. Not quite. A rhythmic, low-pitched *keening*. A sound of profound, unassuageable sorrow. It came from the direction of the lochan.

Isla froze, her breath held. Morag’s words: *If you hear singing by the water… don’t answer it.* This wasn’t singing. It was worse. It was the sound of a heart breaking, over and over.

Against every instinct of modern rationality, she found herself moving. She unzipped the sleeping bag, the cold biting instantly. She crept to the doorway of the bothy, peering out into the gloom.

The mist had lifted slightly over the water. On the near shore, a figure knelt.

It was androgynous, wrapped in what looked like a heavy, sodden plaid. Its head was bowed, and its shoulders moved with the rhythm of the keening. In front of it, in the peaty shallows of the lochan, was a pile of dark cloth. The figure’s hands worked at it, scrubbing, wringing. The water that dripped from the cloth was not clear. Even in the fading light, Isla could see it was dark, like ink, or blood.

The *Bean Nighe*. Here. Not at a ford, but at the source.

Isla’s hand went to the camera around her neck. This was it. The proof. The tangible thing. Her fingers were numb with cold and fear as she lifted the viewfinder to her eye.

The world flipped. The grey lochan, the dark figure, the weeping sky—all composed themselves into a perfect, inverted rectangle of grief. Her thumb found the shutter release. She took a breath, held it.

*Click.*

The sound was absurdly loud in the vast, silent landscape.

The keening stopped.

The figure’s hands stilled. Slowly, with a terrible, deliberate grace, it began to turn its head towards the bothy.

Isla didn’t wait to see its face. She dropped the camera, letting it swing against her chest, and scrambled back into the darkest corner of the hut, pressing herself against the cold stone. She clamped a hand over her own mouth to silence her breathing, which was coming in ragged, panicked gasps.

Minutes passed. An eternity. She heard nothing but the pulse of blood in her ears.

Then, a soft, wet sound at the doorway. A presence, blocking what little light remained.

Isla squeezed her eyes shut, a child’s logic: if I can’t see it, it can’t see me.

A voice filled the bothy. It was the voice from her dream—a impossible chord, a bass note of mountain and a treble note of wind through reeds. It spoke in Gaelic, then seemed to remember itself, switching to English with a soft, sibilant accent.

“You took a piece of the sorrow.”

Isla said nothing. She couldn’t have spoken if she tried.

“The old man with the map. He sent you. The one who thinks in layers.” The voice held no malice. Only a deep, weary curiosity. “He thinks I am a custodian. A symbol. He is… not wrong. But he is not right. I am the wash. And the water. And the cloth. And the stain.”

Isla forced her eyes open.

The figure stood in the doorway, silhouetted. It was not monstrous. It was blurred, as if seen through a rain-streaked window. Its features shifted subtly, never settling. For a moment, the line of a jaw seemed strong, masculine. Then it softened into a curve of cheek, feminine. Its height seemed to change. The only constant was the profound, radiating sadness.

“Why are you here?” Isla whispered, the words tearing from her throat.

“The basket is full,” it said, echoing her dream. “The old patterns are stained through. They will not come clean. The men will not die neatly. The women will not weep correctly. The roles are tangled. The threads are crossed.” It took a step inside. The air grew colder, heavier, smelling of damp earth and ozone. “The ford is choked with unfinished business. Maybe-men. Perhaps-women. They cannot cross. They linger. They… shimmer.”

Isla thought of Finch’s words. *A traffic jam in the metaphysics.*

“What do you do?”

“I wash. I weep. I try to separate the threads. But the solvent… my tears… they are changing. They used to wash away the mortal stain, to prepare the soul for the next shape. Now… they sometimes mix with the stain. Create new colours. New… possibilities.” The figure seemed to look down at its own hands. “I am becoming uncertain.”

The statement hung in the cold air. A cosmic horror, delivered with simple, devastating fatigue.

“What happens if you… become uncertain?”

“The ford becomes a mirror. It reflects back what you bring to it. Not what you are, but what you *might* be. The unbearable potential. For most, it is madness. For a few… it is a door.” It tilted its head, the shifting face regarding her. “You are unfinished. A maybe-woman. You feel it. The old man knew. That is why he sent you. You are a question walking towards a question. It is… polite.”

Isla found a sliver of courage, the academic part reasserting itself. “What is the question?”

The figure was silent for a long time. “*An e fir no boireannach a th’ ann?* That is the old question. The simple one. The new question is… louder. What happens when ‘either/or’ drowns in the ford? What is born in the ‘both/and’? What world grows in the space between the threads?” It took a step back towards the door. “Stay until dawn. Do not follow me to the water. The reflection there is… acute.”

“Wait,” Isla said, pushing herself up. “What’s your name?”

The figure paused. “I was called *Màili* when I was a woman who died in childbirth. I was called *Coinneach* when I was a man who drowned saving a stranger. Now, I am the one who washes. A verb. Not a noun.” It gestured towards the lochan with a dripping hand. “The ford is a day’s walk north, following the stream from this lochan. You will know it. The water runs backwards over its own reflection. Go there at noon, when the sun is highest and the shadows are shortest. The light will show you the truth. Or it will break you.”

Then it was gone, melting into the mist as if it had never been.

Isla slumped against the wall, trembling violently, not from cold, but from a seismic shift in her understanding of reality. She had spoken to a myth. And the myth was having an existential crisis.

She fumbled for her torch, her hands shaking. She shone it around the empty bothy, then on the ground where the figure had stood. The dirt floor was wet. Not with water, but with a dark, iridescent patch, like a spill of oil and pearl.

She took the camera. Her hands steadied as she wound the film to the next frame. She focused on the patch of wet, alien earth, and took another picture.

*Click.*

The sound was a period at the end of a sentence. The first chapter of her old life was closed. She was in the story now, up to her neck. And the water, she knew, was much, much deeper than she had ever imagined.

She spent the night awake, back against the stone, the knife with her blood on it held tight in her hand. The keening did not return. Only the wind, and the vast, listening silence of the glen, and the terrifying, exhilarating sense that all the layers of the world had just grown thin as gauze.

# Chapter 3

## **CHAPTER 3**

Dawn came as a slow dilution of grey. Isla emerged from the bothy stiff and soul-weary, but crackling with a wired, unnatural alertness. The world looked different. Not transformed, but *revealed*. The grass wasn’t just green; it was a thousand shifting shades between yellow and blue, each blade holding a minute bead of mist-light. The lochan was no longer leaden but a deep, swirling violet-black, like a bruise on the skin of the earth. She could see the shimmer.

It wasn’t a visual effect. It was a cognitive one—a sense of latent meaning, of stories trapped in the landscape, pressing to get out. The split rock on the hillside now seemed less a geological accident and more a deliberate punctuation mark in a sentence written in stone.

She ate a cold tin of beans, the taste of tin and salt a grounding banality. Her encounter felt like a dream, but the memory was crystalline, and the dark, iridescent stain on the bothy floor was still there, though it seemed to be fading, soaking into the earth like a secret.

Following the stream from the lochan was easy. It was a cheerful, chattering thing, oblivious to the metaphysical weight it carried towards the ford. The walking was harder, through pathless, boggy ground that sucked at her boots. The midges were mercifully absent, chased away by a cool breeze, but the air remained close, thick with the smell of wet peat and something else—a metallic tang, like ozone after lightning.

Finch’s map became slightly more coherent as she walked. The “rowan struck by lightning” was there, a blackened skeleton of a tree, one bright red berry cluster clinging to a dead branch like a defiant drop of blood. She passed it, feeling a superstitious urge to touch the wood for luck, but resisted.

The valley narrowed, the hills crowding in on either side, steep and scree-strewn. The sound of the stream grew louder, bouncing off the rock. And then, around a final, jutting bend, she saw it.

*Linne nan Daoine Sgàthach.*

It was not dramatic. A widening in the stream, perhaps twenty feet across, where the water slowed and deepened over a bed of smooth, multi-coloured stones. The banks were flat, grassy. A perfectly pleasant spot for a picnic, if not for the atmosphere.

The air here was dead still. The sound of the stream seemed muted, as if heard through glass. And the light was wrong. The sun, nearing its zenith, should have been throwing sharp, short shadows. Instead, the light was diffuse, directionless, coating everything in a flat, pearlescent sheen. It made the world look two-dimensional, a painted backdrop.

And then she saw the water.

Finch’s phrase had been precise. The water ran backwards over its own reflection. It was impossible, a glitch in reality. The stream flowed left to right, as water should. But on the surface, the reflection of the opposite bank—the heather, the rocks, the sky—flowed *right to left*, a perfect, contrary mirror. The effect was nauseating, a visual contradiction that made her brain itch. It was like watching a film where the actor’s lips moved out of sync with the words.

This was the place. The nexus. The clogged drain of the symbolic world.

She stood on the bank, well back from the edge, and simply watched. The longer she looked, the more she saw. Or felt. Flickers at the corner of her vision—shapes that weren’t there when she turned her head. A sense of being watched from multiple points, none of them visible. A low hum, not a sound, but a vibration in her teeth.

She unslung the Rolleiflex. Through the viewfinder, the ford was even more unsettling. The inverted, reversed image somehow made the backwards flow of the reflection seem *more* logical. She took several pictures, the *click-whirr* of the advance lever absurdly profane in the holy silence.

What now? The washer-being had said to come at noon. The sun was almost directly overhead. Was she supposed to… cross? To step into that contradictory water?

A movement on the far bank caught her eye.

A figure emerged from the heather. It was a man, or the shape of one. He was dressed in walking gear—a bright blue waterproof, sturdy boots—but they looked wrong, ill-fitting, as if he’d borrowed them from a larger person. His face was pale, strained. He stood at the edge of the far bank, staring into the water with a look of profound confusion.

He didn’t seem to see her.

He took a step into the ford. The water swirled around his ankles. He flinched, looked down, and his mouth opened in a silent cry of shock. Isla followed his gaze.

Where his boots met the water, the reflection wasn’t of his legs. It was the reflection of a woman’s bare feet, pale and slender, disappearing into the dark water.

The man stared, frozen, at this impossible reflection. He raised his hands. In the water, the woman’s hands rose to meet them. He turned his head to the side. The woman in the water turned her head the opposite way.

He was looking at his *potential*. The other thread in the tangled skein of himself. The maybe-woman he also was.

He began to shake his head, a frantic, denialist motion. *No, no, no.* The reflection mimicked the gesture, but its face held an expression not of denial, but of sad recognition.

Then he did the thing she feared. He looked up, and his eyes met Isla’s across the ford.

He saw her. Really saw her. His expression shifted from personal horror to a desperate, pleading hope. “You!” he called out, his voice cracking. “You see it, don’t you? Tell me you see it! Tell me I’m not mad!”

Isla said nothing. Her role was to observe. To document. Not to intervene.

“It’s in the water!” he screamed, pointing down. “It’s me, but it’s *not* me! What is this place?!”

He took another stumbling step forward, deeper into the ford, now up to his knees. The reflection deepened accordingly. The woman in the water was now visible to her thighs, wearing what looked like a simple, dark dress. The man’s movements became jerky, uncoordinated, as if he was fighting his own body. The reflection’s movements were fluid, graceful.

“I can feel it…” he moaned. “The pull… it wants me to… to *be* that…”

He was breaking. The unbearable potential was unmaking him.

Isla forgot her mandate. She was a human being before she was a folklorist. “Get out!” she shouted, her voice startlingly loud in the muffled air. “Come back to this side! Don’t look at it!”

He focused on her, a lifeline. “Help me.”

He tried to turn, to wade back to his own bank. But his legs wouldn’t obey. They remained locked, knee-deep in the contradictory stream. He struggled, panicked, thrashing. The water churned, but the reflection remained calm, serene, watching him with its sad, knowing eyes.

“I can’t… it won’t let go…”

From upstream, a new sound cut through his panic. The keening. Low, sorrowful, inevitable.

The washer-being was coming.

The man heard it too. His head snapped towards the sound, upstream on his side of the bank. His face drained of all remaining colour. “No… no, not that… I’m not ready… I’m not finished!”

The keening grew louder. And

# Chapter 4

## **CHAPTER 4**

The city’s old quarter smelled of wet stone and forgotten purposes. Leo’s footsteps echoed in the close, a frantic counter-rhythm to the thrumming in his veins. The explorer’s notes, written in a tight, anxious script, had led him here: *‘For corroboration, seek the Silent Chapter, Catheart’s Wynd. Ask for nothing. She will know if you are worth the knowing.’* It was less an address and more a koan, and Leo was in no state for philosophy. He was in a state for answers that didn’t dissolve upon examination, for solid things in a world that had turned to peat-smoke.

Catheart’s Wynd was a gullet between two towering tenements, so narrow the sky was a bruised slit overhead. The shops here were the kind that sold things nobody needed anymore: watch parts for timepieces long shattered, single buttons, faded postcards of a city that had erased itself. Desperation, Leo was learning, had its own taxonomy. The frantic, shrieking kind he’d felt at the ford was one species. This, the slow, sinking kind that came from hunting a ghost through the rain, was another.

He found it tucked where the wynd made a dog’s-leg turn, a window so grime-caked it seemed a deliberate occlusion. Behind the glass, a vague tumble of leather spines and faded gilt. No sign. The door was black oak, scarred by generations of damp, its brass knob green with verdigris. It looked less like a shop and more like a door that had been left behind when the world moved on.

He pushed it open. A bell, high and thin as a toothache, chimed somewhere in the depths.

The air inside was a physical presence. It was the scent of paper decaying with dignity, of old leather holding its shape against time, of dust that had settled into permanence. It was silence given a smell. The shop was a canyon of books, shelves rising into a gloom where the ceiling was lost. Volumes were stacked in leaning towers on the floor, crammed into every crevice, a geography of imminent collapse. Light came from a single, green-shaded banker’s lamp on a vast, claw-footed desk at the room’s heart.

Leo stood just inside the threshold, dripping onto a threadbare rug that depicted some heraldic beast being quietly consumed by moths. He felt assessed, not by a person, but by the accumulated weight of all the unread words.

“You’re letting the damp in.” The voice came from behind a fortress of folios to his right. It was a dry voice, papery, without warmth but without malice. A statement of fact.

He shut the door, and the silence sealed itself again.

From behind the book-fort emerged a woman. She was perhaps sixty, perhaps a hundred; it was impossible to tell in the kind light of decay. Her hair was a long, silver braid over one shoulder, severe as a cable. She wore a high-necked dress of charcoal-grey wool, utterly plain, and her eyes were the colour of flint. She held a small, brass-bound volume in one hand, a feather duster in the other, an absurd juxtaposition. She did not smile.

“I’m looking for…” Leo began, the prepared lie dying on his tongue.

“You are looking,” she interrupted, setting the duster aside with a precision that suggested it was a ceremonial act, “for confirmation that you haven’t lost your mind. A common enough request. The stock is depleted.” Her gaze travelled over him, not like a shopkeeper sizing up a customer, but like a cartographer noting erosion on a familiar coast. It lingered on the bulge in his waxed jacket pocket, where the compass lay against his chest. “You’ve brought something with you. Something that doesn’t belong to you.”

It wasn’t a question. Leo’s hand went to his pocket, protective. “It was left to me.”

“By Alistair Foyle.” She said the name not as a question, but as a verdict. She turned and walked towards the desk, her movements fluid and silent. “He was a regular customer. A man who asked better questions than most, which is why he found better answers. And worse trouble. Come here.”

Leo approached the desk. It was a landscape of organised chaos: sheaves of parchment weighted with smooth river stones, inkwells that looked like they held dried blood, a magnifying glass with a handle of yellowed bone. She did not sit, but stood behind it, a commander at a map-table.

“Show me.”

He hesitated, then drew the compass from his pocket. In the gloom of the shop, the brass seemed to drink the lamplight, glowing with a subdued, inner warmth. He placed it on the blotter between them.

The woman—Elara, he presumed, though no names had been offered—did not touch it. She leaned forward, her flinty eyes narrowing. She didn’t look at the face, or the needle. She looked at the space around it, as if reading its aura. After a long moment, she let out a breath, a soft exhalation that was the first human sound she’d made.

“A Key,” she said, the word capitalised by her tone. “And not a minor one. Foyle had no business carrying this. No more than a child has business carrying a lit torch into a powder magazine.”

“A key to what?” Leo’s voice was barely a whisper, afraid to disturb the gravity in the room.

“To the cracks,” she said, looking up at him. “To the places where the wallpaper of our world has peeled back. You’ve seen one, haven’t you? A crack. A… thin place.”

The ford. The screaming man. The thing in the water. The keening. The memory was a shard of ice in his gut. He nodded, once.

“And you used this.” She gestured to the compass. “Or it used you. They have a sympathy for the turmoil they cause. It pointed you true, I assume. They always point towards the disturbance. It’s their function.”

“What is it?” Leo asked, his hand hovering over the compass, wanting to reclaim it.

“It is a piece of a world that isn’t yours,” Elara said bluntly. “A piece of the Other Side. The world behind the Veil.”

The word hung in the dusty air. *Veil*. It felt right, a word for the fragile film that had seemingly torn at the ford.

“The Veil is… what? A border?”

“A membrane. A story we tell ourselves to make the chaos bearable.” She finally moved, circling the desk to stand closer to him. She was taller than he’d realised. “On one side, here. The rational, the solid, the *explained*. On the other… everything else. The old things. The potential that didn’t make the cut. The echoes of choices unmade. The folklore your academic is so fond of documenting isn’t fiction, Mr.…?”

“Leo. Just Leo.”

“Leo. It isn’t fiction. It’s leakage. Reportage from the front lines of a perpetual, quiet war.” She picked up a river stone from the desk, hefting its cool weight. “This world, our world, is under a kind of siege. Not by armies. By… influence. By reflection. The Veil is thinning. Has been for centuries. And there are those who work to keep it patched, and those who work to rip it wide open.”

Leo’s mind raced, trying to fit the impossible into the frame of the real. “Who? Why?”

“The Wardens,” she said, with a faint, grudging respect. “A scattered, secretive lot. They maintain the old protections, reinforce the weak points. They understand that some mysteries should remain mysterious. That a door exists for a reason: sometimes to be opened, but often to be kept shut.” Her flinty eyes hardened. “And then there are the Harvesters. They see the Veil not as a protection, but as a prison. They believe the power, the pure potential, from the Other Side should be theirs to wield. They pick at the threads. They create… incidents. Like your ford.”

“The man… the reflection…”

“A Harvester’s work,” Elara said, her voice cold. “A deliberate thinning. They create a resonance, a sympathetic wound, to draw the potential through. What happens to the poor soul caught in it is collateral damage. The reflection he saw? That was a potential self, a life he could have lived, bubbling up from the other side. Most people can’t hold that contradiction. It unmakes them. The washer-being… that’s a Warden artifact. A cleaner. It comes to sever the connection, to tidy up the mess. Often, it tidies up the witness, too.”

Leo remembered the keening, the unbearable sorrow in it. A cleaner. The thought was more chilling than any monster.

“Why tell me this?” he asked, suspicion flaring. “Why not just call the… cleaners?”

“Because Foyle gave you the Key,” she said, as if it were obvious. “And because you saw the crack and didn’t immediately go mad. You have a certain… permeability. Rare, and usually unfortunate.” She looked at him, and for the first time, he saw something like curiosity in her face. “And because the Wardens are losing. They are archivists in a fire. The Harvesters are aggressive, organised. They have a taste for the power they steal, and appetite only grows. Your ford was a minor event. A test. There will be more. Bigger.”

She walked back to the shelves, running a finger along a row of spines. “Foyle was tracking them. He believed they were converging on something here, in the city. A weak point not just in space, but in time. A confluence. He was using the Key to map their activity.” She turned. “He is gone. The Key is now active for you. Which means you are now a point of interest. For both sides.”

The weight of it settled on Leo, heavier than the damp in his jacket. He was a man who fixed boilers, who understood pipes and pressure and the tangible. This was a leak in reality itself. “What do I do?”

“First,” Elara said, a hint of a pragmatic, grim teacher in her tone, “you learn to see. Properly. The Key is a crutch. It points, but it doesn’t interpret. You’re blundering about half-blind. In this work, that gets you harvested.” She gestured for him to follow her to a clearer space of floor between the book-towers. “The Veil isn’t a wall. It’s a weave. And where it thins, the light from the other side… leaks. It has a texture. A taste to the mind. You felt it at the ford. That pressure. That sense of *wrongness*.”

He had. The air had been thick with it.

“I want you to close your eyes,” she instructed. “And forget what you know about seeing.”

It felt absurd. But the authority in her voice was absolute. Leo closed his eyes. The darkness was immediate, punctuated by the afterglow of the green lamp.

“Breathe. Listen to the silence here. It’s not true silence. It’s layered. The dust settling. The pages contracting. The building’s old bones settling. Now… feel for the silence beneath that. The one that doesn’t belong.”

He tried. He heard his own heartbeat, the distant drip of a gutter. The dense, woolly quiet of the book-choked room. He strained, feeling foolish.

“Stop trying,” Elara’s voice cut in, gentle for the first time. “It’s not a search. It’s a surrender. Let the room come to you. The way you might notice a change in the hum of a machine you know well.”

He let his focus soften. Let the sounds wash over him without grabbing at them. He breathed in the smell of decay and memory. And then, at the very edge of his perception, he felt it. Not a sound, but a… vibration. A faint, almost musical dissonance, like a single note from a broken piano string sustained underneath everything. It came from the far corner of the shop, behind a tapestry that depicted a tree with black, barren branches.

“There,” he said, opening his eyes and pointing. “A kind of… hum. Sour.”

Elara’s eyebrows lifted a millimetre. Approval. “Good. That is a threadbare spot. A place where, long ago, someone tried to read something best left unread. The psychic stain remains.” She walked to the corner and pulled the tapestry aside. On the stone wall behind it was a dark, water-stain-like patch. But as Leo stared, letting his eyes lose focus, he saw it wasn’t a stain at all. It was a faint, shimmering tracery, like heat-haze, emitting that same subtle, wrong vibration. It was beautiful and sickening.

“This is nothing,” she said, dropping the tapestry. “A scar. The active leaks are brighter. Hungrier. They pull at you. The Key will scream for them. But you must learn to feel them without it. To know the landscape. A Harvester can mask a Key’s reaction. They cannot mask the leak itself to a trained sense.”

For hours, it felt like, she put him through his paces. She had him find other faint, old thin spots in the shop—a corner where a melancholy poet had spent his final years, a patch of floor where a dangerous book had been burned. Each had its own signature: a cold spot, a smell of ozone, a feeling of vertigo. She was a brutal, efficient tutor, offering no praise beyond a curt “adequate” when he correctly identified a subtle, whispering drain of energy near the door.

“The world is riddled with these,” she said finally, as the single lamp seemed to burn brighter in the deepening gloom of late afternoon. “Most are inert. Historical. But new ones are opening. Faster. The Harvesters are not just exploiting weak points; they are creating them. They use human pain as a chisel. Betrayal, grief, madness—these emotions resonate powerfully with the Other Side. They thin the Veil like acid.”

Leo thought of the man at the ford, his personal horror. Had that been natural? Or had it been *cultivated*?

“Why are you telling me all this?” he asked again, exhaustion making him bold. “You’re not a Warden. You’re a bookseller.”

For the first time, Elara smiled. It was a thin, sharp thing, like a paper-cut. “I am a librarian. The Silent Chapter is an archive of the conflict. I preserve the records of both sides. Knowledge is the only weapon that doesn’t blunt. Foyle was a researcher. He is gone. You have his Key. You have the sensitivity. You are, whether you wish it or not, the next data point.” She went to her desk, opened a drawer, and pulled out a small, cloth-wrapped bundle. “Take this.”

He unwrapped it. Inside was a notebook, very old, bound in dark leather. And a pen with a nib of a strange, dark metal.

“Foyle’s field journal. Blank from the midpoint. Where he stopped writing. Or where he was stopped. The pen’s nib is iron-alloy. It will write true, even near strong influences. Your assignment, Leo, is to become a better folklorist than the academic at the ford. Document what you find. Follow the Key. Map the new thin places. Not to intervene. To *witness*. That is the first, and only, rule of the archivist. We observe. We record. We do not get involved.”

“Isla,” Leo said, the name coming out unbidden.

Elara froze. “You know her?”

“I saw her. At the ford. She was watching. She didn’t help.”

“Isla MacLeod,” Elara said, and the name was a sigh. “A gifted observer. A frustratingly rigid student. She follows the old Warden protocols to the letter: witness, document, withdraw. A cleaner was dispatched. The incident is contained. In her view, the man was already lost the moment he saw his reflection.” She fixed Leo with her flinty gaze. “Do not seek her out. Her allegiance is to preservation, not understanding. She would take the Key from you and shut you out for your own good. And her definition of ‘good’ is very, very narrow.”

Leo tucked the journal and pen into his inner pocket. The compass, he returned to its place over his heart. It felt warmer than before. “What do I do now?”

“Go home. Sleep. If you can. The seeing will leave you raw. Tomorrow, start small. Walk your city. Don’t use the Key. Just feel. Listen for the sour notes. Note where the streetlights flicker for no reason, where the shadows don’t match the light, where a feeling of dread pools in a seemingly ordinary alley. Map the cracks in your mind.” She turned back to her desk, dismissal in her posture. “The Silent Chapter is always here. But do not come often. Do not be followed.”

Leo hesitated at the door. The world outside seemed louder, brighter, more fragile than when he’d entered. “Thank you,” he said, though he wasn’t sure what he was thanking her for.

“Don’t thank me,” she said without looking up. “I have just handed you a shovel and pointed you at a minefield. Gratitude is premature.” She glanced at him, a final, assessing look. “And Leo? Trust the feeling in your gut before the thought in your head. The old brain, the limbic sludge, it remembers the Veil is a lie long before the clever part catches up.”

He stepped back into the wynd. The drizzle had hardened into a proper rain, needling his face. The door closed behind him with a soft, final click, and the bell did not chime. He looked at the grimy window, but could see no movement within. The shop might have been empty for a century.

He walked, aiming for the main thoroughfare and the bus back to his flat, to his life of boilers and tangible problems. But he tried to do as Elara said. He softened his gaze. He let the city in.

And he heard them. Faint, but unmistakable.

A low thrum of anxiety from the mouth of a subway station, where a thousand lonely journeys crossed. A cold, sucking emptiness from the doorway of a shuttered charity shop. A shimmer, like a mirage, around the old, condemned church on the corner, where the stone seemed to weep even in the dry. They were not events, not like the ford. They were scars, stains, whispers. But they were everywhere. His city was not a solid thing. It was a lacework, worn thin in countless places, and through the holes he could now sense the constant, whispering draft from the other side.

He fumbled for his keys at the door to his tenement, his hands unsteady. The familiar lock, the scuffed linoleum of the stair—they felt like a stage set, flimsy props against the vast, humming darkness he now knew lay behind them. He climbed to his flat, shut the door, and leaned against it, breathing hard.

In the quiet of his own home, he took out Foyle’s journal. He opened it to the last written page. The handwriting, once tight and controlled, degenerated into a frantic scrawl.

*‘They are not just making cracks. They are making a pattern. A sigil. The city itself is the ritual site. The confluence approaches. The Heart of the Veil is here. They will tear it open and all the old night will come pouring in. I have seen the design in the—’*

The sentence ended in a long, ink-blotted dash, as if the pen had been snatched from his hand.

Leo slowly closed the book. He looked out his window at the glittering, rainy cityscape, the streetlights smearing gold on the wet pavement. A pattern. A sigil. The city itself.

He understood Elara’s final warning now. He wasn’t just holding a key. He was standing on the diagram. And somewhere out there in the damp, gleaming night, Isla MacLeod was watching, documenting, waiting for the cleaners to be dispatched. And others, with a taste for stolen power, were drawing their lines, using human pain as ink, preparing to tear the world he knew right down the middle.

The compass against his chest gave a single, distinct pulse, like a dying man’s heartbeat. It was not pointing anywhere. It was trembling.

# Chapter 5

## **CHAPTER 5**

The rain had settled into a fine, persistent mist, the kind that didn’t fall so much as hang in the air, beading on wool and stone alike. Inside *The Cracked Spine*, the world was reduced to the smell of old paper, damp earth from a potted fern that was losing its fight for life, and the sharp, coppery scent of Leo’s fear. It clung to the back of his throat, a taste more potent than Morag’s whisky.

Elara was a statue by the grimy front window, her fingers barely parting the lace curtain. “Two of them,” she said, her voice a low filament in the quiet. “By the newsagent’s. They’re not even pretending to look at the headlines.”

Leo didn’t need to ask who. The Harvesters. The name felt wrong in his mind, too clean, too agricultural. It suggested a seasonal, natural thing. There was nothing natural about the two figures he’d glimpsed. They wore the city like a cheap suit—standard-issue anoraks, sensible shoes—but they didn’t *fit*. It was in the stillness, the way their gazes swept the street not with curiosity, but with the methodical, blank assessment of a scanner. They were looking for a barcode. His.

“The back?” he whispered, the words dry as tomb dust.

“Watched. They’ve triangulated. They know we’re in the honey pot.” Elara let the curtain fall. She turned, and in the grey light, her face was all planes and shadows, a cliff-face of resolve. “They’ll come in quiet. Try to contain. Minimise the… mess.”

“Mess.” Leo’s laugh was a short, sharp exhalation. He thought of Foyle’s journal, the ink-blotted dash. A different kind of mess. “What do they want? The compass? The journal?”

“The anomaly,” she said, moving past him, her hand brushing a shelf of leather-bound sermons. A faint shimmer, like heat haze, followed her touch. “You. Me. The knowledge. All of it. They tidy up loose threads.”

The bell above the shop door jingled, a sound usually as rare and precious as a gold coin in here. Now, it was the pin-pull of a grenade.

A man entered. He was mid-forties, wearing a NHS-style fleece under his open anorak, a lanyard tucked into his pocket. He could have been a council surveyor, a social worker. He smiled, a bland, professional flex of the lips that didn’t touch his eyes. They were the colour of a frozen puddle.

“Afternoon,” the man said. “Terrible weather. Looking for a local history, something on the old guilds?” His voice was perfectly pitched, a practised, harmless monotone.

Leo’s mouth was desert. He saw the second figure slip in behind the first, a woman with a severe, efficient bob and a large canvas tote bag. She closed the door softly. The *click* of the latch was final.

Elara didn’t bother with the performance. “You’re a long way from your chapter house, Harvester. The air here must taste sour to you.”

The man’s smile solidified, became a thing of porcelain. The woman set her tote bag gently on the floor. From it, she drew not a weapon, but a small, polished brass bowl and a bundle of what looked like grey, knotted twine.

“The artefact and the aberration,” the man said, his gaze settling on Leo. “Standard recall. No need for fuss. You’ll come to no lasting harm.” The promise was colder than a threat.

“Aberration,” Leo echoed. The word buzzed in his skull. A flaw. A glitch. Isla MacLeod’s voice ghosted through his memory: *They clean up the mess.*

Elara took a step forward, placing herself between the Harvesters and Leo. It was a small movement, almost casual, but it altered the geometry of the room. “You use your little tools to skim the surface scum,” she said, her voice gaining a melodic, dangerous edge. “You’ve never had the stomach to dive into the deeps. You don’t know what you’re trying to contain.”

The woman began unknotting the twine, her fingers moving with swift, ritualistic precision. She hummed a low, atonal note that made Leo’s teeth ache.

“Last chance,” the man said, his hand dipping into his fleece pocket.

Elara moved. It wasn’t an attack, not in any way Leo understood. She swept her arm in a wide, graceful arc, as if gathering cobwebs from the air. But what she gathered was the *potential* of the place—the latent energy of ten thousand unread stories, the quiet desperation of Foyle’s final days seeping from the walls, the focused, terrified concentration Leo was radiating like a fever.

The air in front of her rippled, then *sheared*.

It was a soundless, shivering tear. The space between her and the Harvesters didn’t explode; it *unfolded*. The world there became a kaleidoscope of fractured perspectives—Leo saw the man’s frozen smile from three angles at once, saw the spines of books behind him jutting into the space like broken teeth, saw the woman’s humming face superimposed over a flash of the rainy street outside. It was a localized concussion of reality.

The Harvester man staggered back, a line of blood trickling from his nose as if the pressure inside him had been forced out. The woman dropped her twine, her atonal hum cutting off in a gasp. The brass bowl rang like a bell where it hit the floor.

“Run,” Elara said, and the word was a whip-crack.

Leo ran. He bolted for the narrow passage behind the counter that led to the back storeroom and the rear exit. He heard not a bang, but a wet, *unzipping* sound, and a shelf of Victorian encyclopaedias to his left simply ceased to be, replaced by a brief, terrifying glimpse of a swirling, starless violet void before the space snapped back, books raining down as pulp and splintered wood.

The woman was chanting now, real words in a guttural tongue. The air grew thick, resistant. Leo’s legs felt like he was pushing through tar. He glanced back.

Elara stood her ground, her hands weaving patterns that left after-images of silver light. She was pulling threads from the very fabric of the shop, stitching together a shield of fragmented history and forgotten prose. A projectile of condensed, humming silence launched from the male Harvester’s hand. It didn’t fly; it *appeared*, eating the distance instantly. It struck Elara’s makeshift shield.

The sound was the death-cry of a hundred libraries. A shockwave of silent force, visible as a distorting bubble, radiated outwards. It hit the walls. The brick didn’t crack. It *shimmered*, turning briefly translucent, revealing the skeletons of pipes and lathe behind it before solidifying again with a deep, groaning ache. Every pane of glass in the front window webbed into a million fractures, holding its shape for a surreal second before collapsing inward in a slow, glittering cascade.

The Harvester woman had her twine now, stretched between her hands. It was vibrating, emitting a high-pitched whine that sought to cancel out Elara’s weaving. The conflict wasn’t fire and lightning. It was erasure versus creation, a silent, brutal war over what was *allowed* to be real.

Leo hit the back door, shoulder-charging it open into a dank, brick-lined close. The misty air was a slap of cold relief. He turned, shouting for Elara.

She emerged backwards, still facing the ruin of the shop. Her expression was ferocious, a mask of effort, but as she crossed the threshold, she flung a final, contemptuous gesture behind her. It was a dismissal, a sealing.

Inside *The Cracked Spine*, the two Harvesters were converging. The man raised both hands. The woman’s twine glowed white-hot.

Then the world *folded*.

It was as if a giant, invisible hand took the interior of the shop and crumpled it like a sheet of paper. Space compressed, walls met in impossible geometries, the ceiling kissed the floor. It happened in utter silence, a breathtaking, nauseating contraction. For one heartbeat, the shop was a condensed cube of nightmare geometry. Then it *unfolded* again with a deep, sub-audible **thump** that Leo felt in his marrow.

What was left was not rubble. It was a perfect, empty shell. The books, the shelves, the desk, the Harvesters—all of it was gone. Just bare, dusty floorboards, exposed brick, and the gaping maw where the window had been. A smell of ozone and burnt vanilla lingered, the ghost of a spell.

Elara sagged against the close wall, her breath coming in ragged gulps. Sweat plastered dark hair to her temples. “Tidy,” she spat, the word dripping with venom. “They love things tidy. So I gave them… nothing.”

Leo stared at the void where his sanctuary had been. His past, his profession, his last tether to a normal life—sublimated into the aether. There was no anger yet, only a hollow, ringing shock. He fumbled inside his jacket, his fingers closing around the cold brass of the compass. It was bucking in his hand, a live fish desperate for the stream.

“Which way?” he demanded, his own voice strange to him.

Elara pushed off the wall, her eyes on the compass face. The needle was spinning, then catching, then spinning again, as if equally repelled and attracted by everything around them. “They’ve stirred the currents. It’s confused. But the thin places… they’ll call to it. Like to like.” She pointed a trembling finger as the needle gave a violent shudder and held, pointing southwest. “There. Go.”

They fled through the labyrinth of back lanes and service alleys, two ghosts in the afternoon gloom. The compass led them not by streets, but through cracks in the city’s plan: a rusted gate in a high wall, a forgotten pedestrian tunnel under a railway arch dripping with condensation, a gap between two warehouses choked with nettles. Leo’s mind raced, a frantic counterpoint to the pounding of his heart. *Aberration. Recall. Tidy.* He was a spill to be mopped up. Elara was a corrupted file to be deleted. The clinical, impersonal violence of it was worse than any monster. It denied them even the dignity of being a threat. They were a discrepancy.

He glanced at Elara as they ran. Her face was set, but a fine tremor ran through her frame. The display in the shop hadn’t been cost-free. She was draining a battery he couldn’t see.

“The park,” she gasped, as they emerged onto a quiet, tree-lined street of crumbling Georgian townhouses. “Kelvinvale. It’s a… soft spot. A blister on the Veil. The compass knows.”

Kelvinvale Park was less a park than a forgotten memory of one. Locked iron gates, hung with signs warning of unsafe structures, enclosed a wilderness of skeletal trees and rampant rhododendron. The ornate Victorian glasshouses were webs of broken iron and jagged glass. It was a place the city had turned its back on, a pocket of decay.

The compass needle was rigid now, pointing straight through the rusted gates. The air above the park quivered, like tarmac on a hot day.

“The lock,” Leo said, rattling the heavy chain.

Elara placed a hand on the cold iron. She murmured something, a single word that sounded like a sigh. The metal of the padlock didn’t break. It *rusted*, centuries of decay accelerating in seconds, flaking away into orange dust. The chain slithered loose like a dead snake.

They slipped inside. The atmosphere changed instantly. The city’s sounds—distant traffic, a siren—muffled, swallowed by a dense, mossy quiet. The light was different too, greener, older. The path was cracked and veined with weeds. In the centre of the overgrown lawn stood a ruined bandstand, its paint peeled away to grey wood, its roof sagging like a tired mouth.

“Here,” Elara said, stopping in the bandstand’s shadow. She took the compass from him. Her touch was fever-hot. “This will be a door. A short one. Just a step through the curtain. To a… between-place. A bolt-hole they don’t know.”

“A between-place,” Leo repeated, the hollowness in him growing. He was leaving the world. Not in theory, not in a journal. In practice.

Elara was already working. She placed the compass on the damp earth. From her pocket she produced a small, worn blade—not metal, but a shard of dark, glossy obsidian. Without flinching, she drew it across her palm. Blood, shockingly red in the green gloom, welled up. She let it drip onto the compass face, over the sigils.

The blood didn’t smear. It was absorbed, drawn into the engraving like ink into blotting paper. The brass began to glow with a low, internal light.

“Your hand,” she commanded, not looking up.

“What?”

“The door needs a key for each of us. A blood signature. Or it snaps shut behind the first one through.” Her eyes met his, fierce, impatient. “Unless you want to stay and discuss philosophy with the cleaners?”

From the far end of the park, near the gates, there was a flash of unnatural light—a brief, clinical white flare that left no afterimage. They were here. The Harvesters had called for backup. The pursuit was no longer a quiet recall. It was a sweep.

Leo took the obsidian blade. It was colder than ice. He sliced his palm. The pain was sharp, clean, clarifying. He clenched his fist over the compass, his blood joining hers.

The effect was immediate. The compass’s light intensified, beaming upwards, not as a ray, but as a column of shimmering, liquid air. Within the column, the world behind it warped and melted. Leo saw the bandstand, the trees, but they were smeared, dreamlike. And beyond them, he glimpsed something else: a landscape of low, rolling hills under a bruised purple sky, dotted with standing stones that pulsed with a soft, amber light.

Elara began to chant, her voice weaving with the light. The column widened, forming a rippling, vertical pool—a gateway. The air smelled of ozone, of thyme, of turned earth.

A projectile, a sphere of crackling, hungry silence, tore through the rhododendron bushes and impacted the base of the bandstand. The wooden post it hit didn’t shatter. It simply *vanished* in a two-foot section, causing the whole structure to lurch sideways with a groan of protesting timber.

Another flash. Two figures in anoraks, moving with terrifying, coordinated speed across the lawn. A third, taller figure stood at the broken gates, hands raised. The air around him began to *dim*, as if he was drawing all light and sound into himself to forge another weapon.

“It’s open!” Elara screamed over the rising hum of the portal and the deafening silence of the Harvesters’ magic. “Go! Now!”

The gateway shimmered, a mirage made solid. The between-place beckoned, strange, silent, unknown. Leo looked at the lunging Harvesters, their faces blank of everything but purpose. He looked at Elara, her body a taut bowstring, holding the portal open with sheer will, her blood dripping onto the hungry earth.

His hesitation was a fraction of a second. A lifetime. The male Harvester from the shop was ten feet away, his hand extended. From his fingertips leapt not a projectile, but a *line* of nullity, a filament of un-being that snaked towards Leo’s chest, seeking to sever his connection to the world, thread by essential thread.

In that moment, the lens through which Leo saw everything shattered.

Elara was not a guide. She was not a protector. She was a force, spent and straining, holding a door open in a hurricane. The Harvesters were not monsters. They were a system, sterile and efficient, enacting a protocol. He was not a hero, nor a victim. He was a variable. A problem to be solved or a key to be used. The old dynamics—the man leading, the woman supporting; the pursuer and the pursued; the saviour and the saved—were lies. Here, at the fraying edge of everything, there was only power and consequence, will and cost. And choice.

The nullity-line was a foot away. He felt the cold of it, the promise of an end to fear, to confusion, to the terrible, crushing weight of knowing.

Leo did not leap for the portal.

He turned sideways, letting the deadly filament whisper past his ribs. And he grabbed Elara’s **wrist**—not her hand, a deliberate, firm grip on her arm—and *pulled*.

It was not a gesture of rescue. It was an act of equalization. A decision made for both of them. He was not following her. He was ensuring they crossed *together*.

Her chant broke off in a gasp of surprise. Her eyes, wide and furious and perhaps, for the first time, seeing him, met his. The portal wavered.

Then they fell, not into the shimmering light, but *through* it, a tangle of limbs and shared momentum. The last thing Leo saw of his world was the bandstand collapsing in a spray of rotten wood, and the tall Harvester at the gate, lowering his hands, his expressionless face tilting in what might have been, against all odds, a faint nod of professional respect.

The world dissolved into a scream of colour and a silence so profound it was a noise in itself.

***

They landed hard on springy, grey turf. The air was cool, still, and carried the scent of heather and stone. The purple sky was starless, but illuminated by a sourceless, twilight glow. The standing stones formed a loose circle around them, their amber pulses slow and rhythmic, like sleeping hearts.

The gateway winked out behind them, leaving only a faint shimmer in the air that quickly faded.

Leo lay on his back, gasping. His cut hand throbbed. Elara was already pushing herself up onto her elbows, then to her feet. She stared at the spot where the portal had been, then down at her wrist, where his fingers had left red marks on her pale skin. She looked at him, lying in the alien grass.

Her expression was unreadable. Not gratitude. Not anger. A reassessment, sharp and clinical.

“You pulled me,” she said, her voice flat in the dense air.

“You were spent. You’d have been last. They’d have had you.” He sat up, wincing.

“I had calculated the risk.” She took a step towards him, looking down. “I had the timing. My choice. My cost to bear.”

“And my choice was to leave you to it?” He got to his feet, meeting her gaze. The strange light hollowed her eyes. “That’s not how this works. Not anymore.”

A long silence stretched between them, broken only by the soft, pulsing hum of the stones. The dynamic had shifted, irrevocably. He was not cargo. She was not a shield. They were two people in a between-place, one holding a key, the other knowing the locks, both of them bleeding onto the same strange soil.

Elara’s lips tightened. She gave a single, sharp nod. Not agreement. Acknowledgement. “The bolt-hole is a few hours’ walk,” she said, turning to survey the melancholy landscape. “We should move. Gates leave echoes. They might find the resonance.”

Leo followed her gaze. The rolling hills seemed to go on forever, a limbo of stone and twilight. He fished in his pocket, his fingers finding the cool brass of the compass. He pulled it out. The needle was motionless, dead. Here, between places, it had nothing to point to.

He looked back the way they had come. Nothing. No shimmer, no Glasgow rain, no sound of pursuit. Just the silent, watching stones.

Elara was already walking, a dark shape against the purple gloom. Leo took a deep breath of the strange, thin air, and followed. Not behind her. Beside her.

The hook for the next chapter hung in the silent air between them, unspoken: In a place with no maps, with the old rules stripped away, what were they to each other now? And what, in this silent, ancient between-place, was listening to the echo of their footsteps?

# Chapter 6

## **CHAPTER 6**

The trees were not trees. They were memories of trees, sketched in charcoal against a sky the colour of a fading bruise, their branches holding globes of cold, green fire. The Glimmerwood. The name was a courtesy. It was a cathedral of sighing shadows and watchful, phosphorescent life. The air tasted of ozone and damp earth, of a world held in a perpetual, indrawn breath.

Leo walked beside Elara, their footsteps silent on the moss that swallowed sound. The compass was a dead weight in his pocket. Here, there was no north. There was only the soft, sickly glow ahead, and the deeper, velvet black behind. The dynamic between them had settled into a wary, functional silence. He was not cargo. She was not a shield. They were two points of tension on a single, fraying wire.

“The rules are softer here,” Elara said, her voice low, absorbed by the hanging moss. She didn’t look at him. Her eyes tracked the shifting patterns of light in the undergrowth. “Physics is a suggestion. Intent is a weapon. Do not think of predators. They taste thought.”

“What do we think of, then?” Leo asked. His own voice sounded alien, stripped of its Glasgow grit by the consuming quiet.

“The path. Only the path.” She paused, her head tilting. A cluster of violet fungi pulsed at the base of a trunk, a slow, rhythmic beat like a sleeping heart. “The bolt-hole is a fixed point. A knot in the looseness. We aim for the knot.”

They moved on. The forest was a labyrinth of soft light and softer dark. Bioluminescent vines dripped from branches like solidified moonlight. Flowers with petals of stained glass chimed softly as they passed, though there was no wind. It was beautiful, in the way a painted poison was beautiful. It was a beauty that did not care for them.

The attack came not from the dark, but from the light.

They were crossing a small clearing where a pool of silver liquid—water, or something like it—caught and held the forest’s glow. A stand of reeds with stems like crystal and heads of blue flame trembled.

One of the reeds *unfurled*.

It was not a plant. It was a thing of knotted, fibrous muscle, its crystal stem cracking open to reveal a mouth lined with shards of glowing silica. It moved with a whip-crack speed, not towards them, but towards the pool. It struck the silver surface.

The pool *screamed*.

The sound was high, crystalline, a shattering of frequencies that lanced through Leo’s teeth. The liquid light convulsed, and from its agony, the thing drank. It grew, its form bloating, distorting, pulling more substance from the reeds around it, which shrivelled and died into black dust. It was a corruption, a patch of reality where the rules had not just softened, but festered. A wound in the Veil.

“Don’t run,” Elara breathed, frozen. “Running is prey.”

The creature—a Glimmerghast, the name surfaced from some cold corner of Leo’s mind—turned. It had no eyes, but the front of its bulbous, pulsing body oriented towards them. It tasted their stillness, their shock. It began to flow across the moss, a wave of cancerous light and snapping crystal.

“Ideas,” Leo muttered, the word a curse. “You said intent.”

“Your intent is to *not be eaten*,” Elara shot back, her clinical tone fraying at the edges. “Focus it. Shape it. A wall. A cliff. Something it cannot cross.”

He thought of stone. Not just any stone. The black, wet cobbles of the alley behind *The Hanged Man*. The immovable, grimy, centuries-old foundation of a city that refused to be pretty. He fixed the image in his mind, the smell of damp and rubbish, the unyielding solidity of it. He pushed the idea out in front of them, a mental barricade.

The Glimmerghast hit an invisible boundary five feet away. It recoiled, a sizzle of corrupted energy rising from its front. It probed again, confused. The air shimmered with the heat of a summer pavement after rain.

“Good,” Elara said, the word tight. “Now, while it’s confused. A diversion. Something bright and loud. The opposite of us.”

Leo’s mind scrabbled. Bright and loud. A pub fight. The crash of a bottle, the sudden flare of shouted fury. He imagined it off to the left, behind a thicket of pulsing ferns—a burst of violent sound, a flash of aggressive light.

The creature rippled, then slithered towards the phantom noise, its hunger redirected.

“Now we *do* run,” Elara said, and she was moving, not in a panicked sprint, but in a low, swift glide towards the far tree line.

Leo followed, the image of the cobbles dissolving in his mind. His head throbbed, a deep, unfamiliar ache behind his eyes. Using his mind as a tool felt like trying to write with a broken arm. They plunged back into the deeper wood, leaving the clearing and its corrupted guardian behind.

After a hundred yards, Elara slowed, leaning against a trunk whose bark was etched with softly glowing runes. She was breathing hard.

“You used thought as a tool,” she said, watching him. “Instinctively. That is… uncommon.”

“I used a memory as a tool,” he corrected, rubbing his temples. “There’s a difference.”

“Is there?” She pushed off the tree. “Here, memory has weight. Substance. Thank you.”

It wasn’t gratitude. It was an entry in a ledger. *Asset: capable of rudimentary psychic defence.* He gave a short nod, mirroring her earlier acknowledgement. The ledger was balanced, for now.

They had gone another half-mile when the arrow buried itself in the tree between them with a sound like a sigh ending in a thud.

Leo froze. Elara’s hand went to the dagger at her belt, her body coiling.

“Step apart. Hands where I can see them.” The voice came from above, male, laced with a weary cynicism that felt as permanent as the forest’s twilight.

A figure dropped from the high branches, landing in a crouch that absorbed the impact without sound. He straightened. He was tall, lean, wrapped in dun-coloured leathers that seemed to drink the light. His hair was shorn close to his scalp, his face all sharp angles and guarded eyes the colour of flint. A long, elegant bow was held loosely in his left hand, a second arrow already nocked but not drawn. A Warden.

“This path is closed,” he said, his gaze flicking between them, assessing, dismissing, reassessing. He lingered on Elara’s clothing—the practical, otherworldly cut of it—and on Leo’s Glasgow-pale face. “Turn back. Whatever you’re fleeing, it’s kinder than what’s ahead.”

“We are not fleeing,” Elara said, her voice reclaiming its flat authority. “We are seeking. The bolt-hole at Greywatch.”

The Warden’s expression didn’t change, but the cynicism in his eyes deepened. “Everyone seeks Greywatch. Most are lies. Some are traps. All are a pain in my arse. Who sent you?”

“No one sent us. We came through the Standing Stones gate. From the other side.”

Now he went very still. The forest’s ambient hum seemed to grow louder. “The Glasgow anchor,” he said, finally. “It’s been quiet for decades. Why now?”

“Because it’s failing,” Leo said. The words were out before he could filter them. “The Veil is thin. Things are coming through. We have a key. She knows the locks.”

The Warden’s eyes snapped to Leo. “A key.” He held out a hand, expectant. “Show me.”

Leo glanced at Elara. Her lips were a tight line, but she gave a microscopic nod. He reached into his inner pocket, drew out the cloth-wrapped bundle, and carefully unfolded it. The iron key lay on the cloth, inert, a piece of mundane craftsmanship.

The Warden did not touch it. He leaned close, his eyes narrowing. Then he breathed a single, soft word onto its surface. The key shivered. From its bow to its tip, a tracery of silver light flared—a map of tiny, intricate sigils—before fading back to black iron.

“Hmph.” He straightened. “Authentic. Stolen, I assume.”

“Retrieved,” Elara countered.

“Semantics are for people with time to spare.” He slung his bow over his shoulder. “I’m Kael. You’ve stumbled into my patrol sector. Greywatch is a day’s hard travel from here, through the worst of the soft zones. I’ll guide you. Not because I like you. Because the key cannot fall to the Glimmerghasts, or the Static, or whatever else is chewing on the edges of the world. You are cargo. I am the deliveryman. Try not to die before I can offload you.”

He turned and began walking without waiting for agreement. Leo and Elara exchanged a look. It was the same look they’d shared in the grass by the stones: a reassessment. They fell in behind him, not beside him. The hierarchy, it seemed, was a fluid thing.

Kael set a brutal pace. He moved through the Glimmerwood not as an intruder, but as a part of its grim ecology, avoiding the prettiest glades and the darkest hollows with equal suspicion. He pointed out dangers with the bored tone of a tour guide in a hellscape: “Singer Vines. They’ll harmonise with your heartbeat and stop it. Step wide.” “That moss isn’t moss. It’s a collective digestive system. Keep to the stone.”

The forest began to change. The trees grew more twisted, their bioluminescence erratic, stuttering like faulty neon. The air took on a metallic tang. A sound emerged, a low, pervasive static, like a radio tuned between stations.

“Reality Static,” Kael said, not breaking stride. “The weave of things is unravelling here. Don’t look at it directly. Don’t listen to the voices in the noise. They’re just echoes of might-have-beens and never-weres. They’ll hollow you out.”

They crested a rise and looked down into a valley. A river cut through it. But this was no watercourse. It was a flowing, molten ribbon of pure white light, silent and searing. The River Aether. Its banks were lined with jagged, dark rock, and the static hissed where the light met the stone.

“We cross here,” Kael said, stopping at the bank. The light reflected in his flinty eyes, making them look like chips of glass.

“Cross?” Leo stared at the river. It gave off no heat, but looking at it made his vision swim, his thoughts fragment. “It’s liquid light.”

“It’s a current of raw potential,” Kael corrected. “It will hold your weight if your will holds. If your focus wavers, it dissolves you into ambient possibility. A pleasant way of saying you become a footnote in the universe.” He turned to them. “Your turn to prove you’re not just baggage. You first, key-bearer.”

Leo looked at Elara. Her face was a mask, but he saw the tension in her jaw. She was a creature of knowledge, of calculated risk. This was a test of pure, stubborn presence. Of *being*.

“Think of your anchor,” she said quietly. “The most solid, undeniable thing you know. Fix it in your mind. Be heavier than the doubt.”

Leo thought of the whisky glass in *The Hanged Man*. The weight of it in his hand. The specific curve of it. The peat-bog ghost inside. It was a small, solid truth. He stepped onto the light.

It was like walking on thickened air, on the surface tension of a dream. The light yielded slightly, then held. A cold, not-unpleasant sensation crawled up his legs. He could feel the river’s pull, not physically, but mentally—a seductive whisper to let go, to flow apart, to become endless and meaningless. He kept the glass in his mind, its weight, its *thereness*. Step by step, he moved across the twenty-foot span, reaching the far bank with a shudder of relief that felt like waking from a deep sleep.

Elara went next. He watched her. She did not close her eyes. She stared straight ahead, her posture rigid. He wondered what anchor she used. A theorem? A chemical formula? A memory of a locked door? She crossed with a swift, sure grace, joining him on the bank, her breath coming out in a short, sharp exhale.

Kael crossed last, moving with the casual indifference of a man crossing a familiar street. He barely seemed to concentrate.

“Adequate,” he said, landing beside them. “The Static patches are worse. Follow my steps exactly.”

The far side of the valley was a nightmare of fractured perception. Patches of the landscape flickered—a tree would be there, then be a stone, then be a skeletal hand reaching from the earth, all in the space of a second. The static noise rose and fell, and within it, Leo could almost make out words, his name, Morag’s laughter, the sound of city rain. He clenched his jaw, focusing on Kael’s boot heels.

They were picking their way through a field of crystalline flowers that chimed with a discordant, maddening melody when Kael held up a fist. He pointed.

Ahead, the very air was torn. A vertical rift, like a jagged scar in the world, hung between two rocks. Through it, they could see not the Glimmerwood, but a sun-drenched, alien desert, vast and empty. The view wavered, then switched to a deep ocean trench, then to a bustling, neon-lit city street Leo didn’t recognise. The static here was a roar.

“A full rupture,” Kael whispered, his cynicism replaced by pure, professional dread. “Don’t move. Its attention is… random.”

But as they watched, the rift’s cycling slowed. It settled on the desert. And from the blistering heat of that otherwhere, something *stirred*. A shape of sand and shadow began to coalesce on the other side of the tear, turning towards the opening, towards the scent of their reality.

Kael’s hand went to his bow. Elara’s dagger was in her hand. Leo felt the key grow warm against his chest.

The thing in the desert took a step towards the rift.

And a new voice, old and dry as stone, spoke from the darkness behind them. “Do not engage the phantom. It is a mirror. It feeds on conflict.”

They turned. An old man stood there, wrapped in a cloak of woven shadows. His beard was long and grey, his eyes milky with cataracts that seemed to see too much, not too little. In his hand was a staff of petrified wood, capped with a dormant glow-moss.

“Warden-Captain,” Kael said, his posture shifting to something resembling respect, edged with surprise.

The old man ignored him, his blind eyes seeming to rest on Leo. “You carry the iron and the question. The forest has been whispering of your footfalls.” He turned his head towards the rift. With a tap of his staff on the ground, the tear in the world sealed with a sound like a sigh, leaving only undisturbed, if flickering, forest air. The static faded to a murmur.

He looked back at them. “Greywatch is not a sanctuary. It is a diagnosis. You will come with me. The Council of Knots will decide if you are a symptom, or the cure.”

He turned and began to walk into the deeper gloom. Kael gestured for them to follow, his earlier arrogance subdued.

Leo fell into step, Elara a silent presence at his shoulder. The hook from the stones was still there, hanging between them, but it had grown barbs. What were they to each other? A key and a lock. A memory and a tool. But to this old man, to this Council, they were something else entirely: a question to be answered. And in the Glimmerwood, where thought had weight, a question could be a dangerous, living thing.

# Chapter 7

## **CHAPTER 7**

The safehold was a diagnosis, and the prognosis was grim.

They followed the Warden-Captain—Alistair, his name was, a sound as worn and functional as an old spade—through a labyrinth of silent giants. The trees gave way to fungi, colossal and petrified, their stems broad as tower keeps, their caps forming a tiered, sagging ceiling high above. It was a cathedral of rot, arrested mid-collapse and turned to stone. The air here was different. It didn’t smell of pine and damp earth, but of chalk dust and deep, forgotten cellars. The Glimmerwood’s usual whisper was muted, replaced by a low, sub-aural hum, like the memory of a bell.

The village was built into the fungi themselves, a vertical warren of rope bridges, lantern-lit galleries carved into the stems, and shuttered windows peering from under the caps’ leathery eaves. Wraith-light lanterns, filled with captive glow-moss, cast a sickly, steady illumination. It was a place of deliberate quiet, of held breath. People moved with the efficient, hushed urgency of surgeons in a ward. Their eyes, when they flickered towards the newcomers, held no curiosity, only a swift, assessing glare before returning to their tasks. This was not a home. It was a garrison in a war where the front line was everywhere, and the enemy was the air itself.

Alistair led them to a chamber carved into the base of the largest mushroom. It was round, the walls striated with the fossilized gills of the long-dead fungus. A table of scarred darkwood dominated the space, around which sat three other Wardens. A man with a face like a hatchet and hair shorn to grey bristle; a woman with eyes of flint and hands permanently stained with something that looked like verdigris; and a younger man, lean and tense, who tapped a restless rhythm on the table with a stylus.

“The Council of Knots,” Alistair said, lowering himself onto a stool with a soft groan of old bones. “Such as it is. Report, Kael.”

Kael’s arrogance had been sheathed. He stood straight, his voice stripped of its usual lacquer. “Harvester pack, drawn to a significant resonance event. The outsider”—a nod to Leo—“triggered a memory-stone. The echo was potent. It drew the rift, and the phantom within. We were engaged when you arrived.”

The hatchet-faced man, Garvin, spoke. His voice was the sound of gravel shifting. “And the outsider carries the iron key.”

It wasn’t a question. Leo felt the weight of the key beneath his tunic, a cold tooth against his skin. “I do.”

The woman, Anya, leaned forward. The verdigris on her fingers seemed to pulse faintly in the lantern light. “Where did you acquire it?”

“From a dead man. An explorer. He had a journal.” Leo’s voice sounded too loud in the sepulchral quiet. He kept it low, matching the room’s tone. “He thought it could fix things.”

“Fix things,” Garvin repeated, the words a dry mockery. “The Veil isn’t a torn sail, boy. It’s a dying nerve. You don’t *fix* a nerve. You manage the pain until the limb goes necrotic.”

Alistair’s milky eyes seemed to settle on a point just above Leo’s head. “The explorer. Eamon Vale. A romantic. He believed in cures. In permanence.” He tapped his staff once on the stone floor. A ripple passed through the moss-light, dimming it for a heartbeat. “The decay accelerates. Rifts that once took a season to form now bloom in a week. Phantoms grow bolder. The Harvesters… they are no longer just scavengers. They are hunting with purpose.”

“The key is a stabilizer,” said the younger man, Rhys, his tapping ceasing. “A theoretical one. Vale’s hypothesis. It resonates with the foundational frequencies of the Veil. In the right location, with the right catalyst, it could theoretically reinforce the pattern. Like re-knitting a stitch in the world’s fabric.”

“Theoretical,” Anya echoed, her flint eyes on Leo. “The catalyst is the Heartstone. A myth. A children’s story Wardens tell to make the slow collapse seem optional.”

“Where is it?” Elara’s voice, her first words since entering the chamber, cut through the thick air. She stood beside Leo, not behind him, a solid, silent presence until now. “The journal mentioned a compass. Leo has it.”

All eyes shifted to her. A woman, speaking plainly in a council of men. Garvin’s jaw tightened. Anya’s expression did not change, but her attention sharpened, a whetstone drawn along a blade.

“The compass points,” Alistair said, ignoring the implicit challenge in Elara’s posture. “It points to the place where the Veil was first woven. The Foundry. What Vale called the Heartstone is there, if it exists. It is the keystone of the arch. But the Foundry is not a place on a map. It is a memory in the world’s bones. To reach it requires walking paths that are… disagreeable. They twist. They forget themselves. Many Wardens have been sent to find it. They are still sent. Their bones are likely part of the path now.”

“So you do nothing,” Leo said. The words were out before he could temper them. The peat-bog ghost of his own frustration rose in his throat. “You sit in your stone mushrooms and diagnose the dying nerve.”

The silence that followed was absolute, and colder than the deep forest.

“We hold the line,” Garvin hissed. “We suture the rifts that we can. We cull the phantoms and drive off the Harvesters. We maintain the diagnosis, because the alternative is a chaos that would swallow your world in a fortnight. You speak of doing. You are a tourist of catastrophe.”

“He is a key-bearer,” Rhys countered, his voice tense. “However he came by it. The forest whispers of his footfalls, Captain. You said it yourself. That is not nothing. That is a variable.”

“A variable we cannot control,” Anya said. “An outsider, with an outsider’s brute understanding. And a shadow.” Her gaze flicked to Elara. “A woman of sharp edges and silent motives. You trust this combination?”

Kael shifted. “The shadow saved my life from the Harvesters. Her motives are her own, but her blade is… pragmatic.”

It was as close to an endorsement as Kael could muster. Elara did not acknowledge it. Her eyes were on Anya, a silent, level stare that seemed to parse the Warden’s distrust, categorize it, and set it aside as irrelevant.

Alistair sighed, a sound like pages crumbling in an old book. “The Council is divided. This is the nature of knots. They tighten or they loosen, but they seldom unravel cleanly.” He turned his blind face towards Leo. “You will remain in the safehold. You will give Vale’s journal to Rhys for study. We will observe. We will diagnose *you*. Then we will decide.”

It was a dismissal. A postponement. The hook that had been set between Leo and Elara, the question of what they were to each other, now had another barb: what were they to these people? A specimen. A variable.

Garvin stood. “I’ll have quarters prepared. Guarded quarters.”

***

The quarters were a cell, politely named. A small room carved high in a smaller fungus, reachable by a single, narrow bridge. A slit window looked out over the eerie, lantern-stippled village below. The door had no lock, but Kael was posted outside, his presence a reminder that some cages are made of expectation and duty.

“Some sanctuary,” Leo muttered, dropping the worn leather satchel that contained Eamon Vale’s journal onto a low cot.

Elara stood by the window, her back to him, a silhouette against the fungal glow. “They are afraid. Fear makes people rigid. It makes them grasp control, even if it’s an illusion.”

“You’re not afraid?”

“Fear is a tool. Like my dagger. You learn its weight, its balance. You do not let it learn you.” She turned. The wraith-light hollowed her cheeks, made her eyes into dark pools. “They will not let us go. They will study the journal, they will debate, and while they debate, the Veil frays another inch. Garvin would sooner lock the key in a box and forget the path than risk an outsider on it.”

Leo sat on the cot, the weight of the day a physical pressure. “Alistair knows more than he’s saying. About the key. About me.”

“He sees with more than eyes,” Elara said. “The Glimmerwood speaks to him. It told him of your footfalls. That is why he is divided. He hears the variable in the static.”

Leo pulled the journal from the satchel. He had only read fragments, pieces caught in the panic of flight and the glare of memory-stones. Now, in the grim quiet, he opened it. The handwriting was a frantic, sloping thing, often interrupted by sketches—geometric patterns, ley-line diagrams, the twisted spires of the tower from his vision.

He read.

*Entry 47: The Wardens are good men and women, brave to the point of stupidity. But they are firefighters, not architects. They patch the holes in the dam. They do not seek to repair the crack in its foundation. They have forgotten the Foundry.*

*Entry 51: The compass is not just a pointer. It is a tuning fork. The key is the striker. The Heartstone is the resonator. The theory is sound. The mathematics of the Weave, passed down in fragments, suggest a locus of primal stability. A place where the Veil is not a patchwork, but a single, flawless tapestry.*

*Entry 89: I have seen the Tower in the resonance of a thousand-year-old stone. It is real. It is the needle around which the Veil was spun. The Heartstone rests at its peak. But the path… the path is a labyrinth of the world’s regrets. It is not a distance to travel. It is a price to pay.*

*Entry 102: They think me a madman now. Perhaps I am. But a madman with a key is still a man with a key. I will go. If I do not return, let this journal find someone who still believes in cures, not just condolences.*

Leo’s fingers traced the sketch of the tower. It was exactly as he had seen it: the impossible angles, the sense of it being both there and not-there, a thing that hurt the eyes to study. The compass, tucked into the journal’s back cover, felt warm. He took it out. The needle, which had spun erratically before, now trembled, pointing insistently in a single direction—east, through the solid wall of their cell.

“It’s not a myth,” he said, his voice quiet. “He believed it. He *knew* it.”

Elara moved from the window, sat beside him on the cot. Not close, but the shared space was a concession. She looked at the journal, at the compass. “Belief is not proof.”

“No. But it’s a map.” He looked at her. The guarded distance was still there, the barbs on the hook between them. But there was also this: the shared silence, the shared cell, the shared sense of being a variable in someone else’s failing equation. “They won’t let us go. You know that.”

“I know.”

“So we don’t ask.”

A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched her lips. It wasn’t warm. It was tactical. “The guard outside is proud. And distracted by his own subordination. He will be listening for argument, for pleading. He will be less prepared for silence, followed by decisive action.”

“Can we get past him?”

“We are a key and a shadow,” she said, standing. “We are definition and absence. A man who relies on his eyes is at a disadvantage.”

She moved to the door, not to open it, but to place her ear against the fossilized wood. After a moment, she nodded. She pointed to the slit window, then made a series of swift, precise gestures with her hands—a downward climb, a path along a ledge, a descent into a darker patch of gloom between two fungal stems. A route. She had not spent her time at the window admiring the view. She had been diagnosing their cage.

Leo’s heart hammered against his ribs. This was madness. It was also the only thread of sense left. He carefully repacked the journal and compass, slung the satchel across his chest. He joined Elara at the door.

She held up a hand, counting down with her fingers.
Three.
Two.
One.

She did not open the door. Instead, she slammed the heel of her hand against the wall beside it, a sharp, loud crack that echoed in the small space.

From outside, Kael’s voice: “What was that?”

Elara made no sound. Leo held his breath.

The door swung inward. Kael stood there, bow not nocked but held ready, his sharp eyes scanning the room. He saw Leo first, standing near the cot. He did not see Elara, who had melted into the deep shadow in the angle behind the opened door.

“What are you—?” Kael began.

Elara moved. It was not an attack. It was a pressure. Her forearm came across his throat from behind, not choking, but stifling a shout. Her other hand struck a precise point on his wrist. His bow clattered to the floor. She hooked a foot around his ankle and dropped him to his knees, all in one fluid, silent motion. Before he could draw breath to curse, she leaned close, her voice a whisper by his ear.

“You are a good Warden, Kael. You hold the line. We are going to try and mend it. Do not follow us for one hour. That is the price of your life back in the forest.”

She released him, stepped back. Kael coughed, his face a mask of fury and stunned respect. He did not call out. He looked from her to Leo, his jaw working.

“You’ll die out there,” he rasped.

“Probably,” Leo said. “But we’ll die moving towards something. Not just away from everything else.”

Elara was already at the window, slipping through the slit with an eel’s grace. Leo followed, the stone scraping against his shoulders. Outside, the world was a vertical maze of fungal architecture and deep, whispering darkness. He looked back, once, at Kael, who remained on his knees, a sentinel defeated not by force, but by the sheer, untenable logic of their choice.

Then Leo turned, gripped the rough, petrified flesh of the mushroom stem, and followed the shadow down into the gloom.

***

The argument in the Council chamber was a low, tense vibration in the stone. Garvin’s gravel voice rose in sharp rebuttal to Rhys’s insistent tenor.

“—cannot risk the variable becoming a vector! We contain, we observe!”

“Observation is a luxury our timeline no longer affords, Garvin! The resonance spikes are geometric now, not arithmetic! The patient is crashing, and you’re still taking its pulse!”

Alistair sat between them, a statue of weary stone. Anya watched, her stained fingers steepled, her flint eyes seeing all the possible fractures in the room.

The alarm, when it came, was not a bell. It was a shift in the hum of the safehold itself—a sudden, discordant shudder that ran through the petrified fungi, making the lantern lights sway. A moment later, a Warden scout burst into the chamber, her face slick with panic and something dark that wasn’t sweat.

“Breach! South spire! Harvesters—a full swarm. They’re not scavenging. They’re cutting. They’re targeting the anchor-stones!”

All debate died. Diagnosis gave way to triage.

Garvin was on his feet, barking orders. Anya was already moving, pulling vials of glimmering powder from her belt. Rhys grabbed his stylus, which now glowed with a harsh, blue-white light. Only Alistair moved slowly. He turned his blind eyes towards the ceiling, as if listening to the scream of the stone.

“They are not here for us,” he said, his dry voice cutting through the chaos. “They are a distraction. A violent, bloody diversion.”

His milky gaze swept the room, finding the empty space where Kael should have been standing guard outside. He understood. The knot had tightened, but in a way none of them had predicted.

“The key,” he said. “They are here for the key.”

***

The world below the safehold was a throat of darkness. Leo and Elara moved through it, a desperate, silent partnership. The compass needle was a persistent tug in Leo’s hand, leading them through gullies of soft, phosphorescent moss and over ridges of brittle, dead coral that might have been ancient fungus. The Glimmerwood here was sickly, its whispers frayed with static. Things scuttled in the blackness, but did not approach. It was as if they, too, were holding their breath.

They found a stream, black water running over stones that gleamed like obsidian, and followed it, using its sound to mask their passage. After an hour of brutal, scrambling progress, Elara held up a fist. They froze.

Ahead, the stream vanished into a cavern mouth. And clustered at the entrance, like flies on a wound, were Harvesters. Not a pack. A swarm. Dozens of them, their chitinous plates clicking in a restless, hungry rhythm. They were digging at the cavern entrance with their blade-limbs, prying loose the glowing anchor-stones that pulsed with a weak, steady light. The stones, once free, were tossed into a crude sack carried by a larger, hulking Harvester.

“They’re mining the stability,” Leo whispered, horror dawning. “They’re not just breaking through. They’re taking the pieces.”

Elara’s eyes were calculating. “The safehold is under attack. This is the other front. They cripple the Wardens’ home, and steal the tools that might fix the Veil. This is… coordinated.”

It was a thought more terrifying than any phantom. Mindless scavengers were one thing. An enemy with strategy was another.

They were trapped. The compass needle pointed directly through the cavern the Harvesters were dismantling. To go around would mean days, perhaps, and the path was already disagreeable. The safehold was behind them, likely in chaos. The hook between them now was a chain, pulling them forward into a swarm.

“We can’t fight through that,” Leo said, the truth a cold stone in his gut.

“No,” Elara agreed. Her gaze was not on the Harvesters, but on the black stream. It flowed into the cavern. “We go under.”

Before he could question, she was moving, sliding down the bank into the icy, lightless water. It came to her waist. She looked back at him, a challenge in her eyes. No debate. Only action.

Leo followed. The water was a shock, a cold so profound it felt like a brand. He gasped, the sound too loud. A few Harvesters at the periphery of the swarm turned their eyeless heads towards the sound. Elara sank lower, until only her head was above the surface, and began to move forward, using the cavern wall as a guide. Leo mimicked her, the satchel with the journal held above the water like a offering.

They slipped into the cavern mouth, inches beneath the clicking, digging horrors above. The water deepened. Soon, they were submerged entirely, swimming through utter blackness, the only sound the thunder of their own hearts and the muffled *clack-scrape* from above. Leo’s lungs burned. He kicked forward, blind, trusting Elara’s sense of direction in the dark.

His hand brushed something—a root, a tendril. It wrapped around his wrist with a gentle, insistent pressure. He jerked back, but it held. Panic flooded him. He thrashed, bubbles exploding from his lips.

A hand found his in the dark. Elara’s. It was firm, certain. She pulled, not away from the tendril, but deeper along its length. He understood. A guide rope. He stopped fighting, let her lead. The tendril—a root of some submerged, glowing plant—pulsed with a soft blue light, revealing a narrow, water-filled tunnel. They followed it, pulling themselves along the root.

After an eternity of cold and crushing dark, the root led them upward. They broke the surface in a small, air-filled bubble within the rock, gasping. Phosphorescent fungi dotted the ceiling, providing a ghostly illumination. They were in a side cavern, far from the Harvester swarm. The sound of digging was a distant, ominous rumble.

Elara hauled herself out of the water, then turned and offered Leo a hand. He took it. Her grip was strong, cold as the water, and for a moment, they were connected not by mystery or necessity, but by the simple, solid fact of survival. He collapsed on the rough stone beside her, shivering.

“You… you knew that was there?” he managed between ragged breaths.

“I guessed. Water finds the path of least resistance. So do we.” She was wringing out her hair, her movements efficient, unshaken. “The Harvesters are focused on the man-made anchors. They ignore the world’s own architecture. A weakness.”

It was more than a guess. It was a reading of the terrain, of the enemy, of the possibilities in the darkness. Leo looked at her, this woman of sharp edges and silent motives, and felt the hook between them transform. It was no longer just a question. It was a tether. He might not know what she was, but he knew, with a certainty that went deeper than the cold in his bones, that he would follow her into the dark again.

The compass, when he pulled it from the sodden satchel, was still warm. The needle pointed ahead, down a dry, descending passage leading out of the cavern. He checked the journal. The pages were damp, but the ink, miraculously, held. He found the final entry, one he had missed before.

*Last Entry: The price of the path is memory. The Tower guards itself with echoes. To reach the Heartstone, you must be willing to lose what you hold most dear. Not to death. To forgetting. The Veil forgets. To mend it, you must remind it. And reminding requires a sacrifice. I go now. I take my memories of a green hill and a woman’s laugh. I offer them to the path. May they be enough.*

A sacrifice. Not of blood, but of self. Leo thought of his own sparse memories—a vague sense of a city, a life of quiet desperation, the peat-bog ghost of a whisky he hadn’t tasted in weeks. What did he hold most dear? He wasn’t sure he had anything left to lose. Perhaps that was the only qualification he had for this.

“We need to move,” Elara said, standing. “The diversion won’t last forever. The Wardens will contain the breach, or die trying. Then they will come for us.”

They moved down the passage. The air grew warmer, drier. The fungal light faded, replaced by a different glow—a pale, silver radiance that seeped from the rock itself. The passage opened abruptly.

They stood on the edge of a vast, subterranean canyon. A river of molten silver, slow and silent, flowed far below. And spanning the canyon, a bridge of woven light and stone, impossibly ancient, led to the far side.

On the far side, rising from the canyon wall, was the Tower.

It was exactly as in the journal, as in his vision. It defied geometry, its spires twisting in ways that made the mind recoil. It was built of a material that was neither stone nor metal, but something that drank the silver light and gave back only deeper shadow. It was a hole in the world’s understanding. The compass needle vibrated, pointing straight across the bridge to its yawning, dark entrance.

The Heartstone was there. The cure, or the end of all things.

But between them and the bridge, standing motionless in the center of the path, was a figure. It was not a Harvester. It was humanoid, clad in tattered robes that might once have been Warden grey. Its face was in shadow, but from it emanated a profound, hollow silence. A vacuum where the world’s whisper should have been.

“A phantom,” Leo breathed. “But… solid.”

“Not a phantom,” Elara said, her dagger already in her hand. Her voice was tight, a wire about to snap. “A memory. One that has eaten too many others. A guardian.”

The figure raised its head. Where its face should have been, there was only a swirling, starless night. And from that night, a voice echoed, not in their ears, but in the vault of their own memories. It was Alistair’s voice, and Garvin’s, and Morag’s from a pub a world away, and the desperate scratch of Eamon Vale’s pen, and the sound of Leo’s own forgotten heartbeats.

**“To cross,”** the chorus of stolen voices intoned, **“is to be unmade. The bridge is not for the living. It is for the essential. What will you leave behind?”**

It took a step towards them. The ground did not shake. The air did not stir. But Leo felt a part of himself—the memory of the whisky’s heat, the specific weight of a Glasgow rain—thin and stretch, as if being pulled towards that hungry, starless face.

Elara shifted her stance, a low growl in her throat. Not fear. Fury. “It feeds on conflict,” she said, quoting the Warden-Captain’s first words to them. “On engagement.”

“Do not engage the phantom,” Leo whispered, the lesson returning. “It is a mirror.”

But this was no mere mirror. This was a maw. And it stood between them and the only thing that might make any of this suffering mean something.

The figure took another step. The memory of Isla MacLeod’s name, the taste of peat-smoke, began to blur at the edges.

Elara looked at Leo, her eyes reflecting the Tower’s impossible silhouette. The question hung between them, sharper than any blade, more binding than any hook. Not what they were to each other. But what they were willing to become, or un-become, to cross.

“A key and a shadow,” she said, her voice barely a breath. “What does a shadow leave behind?”

She turned towards the advancing guardian, not with her dagger raised to strike, but held low, a tool for a different task. She was not going to fight it.

She was going to pay the price.

Leo understood, with a jolt of terror that was pure and clarifying. The journal’s warning. *The price of the path is memory.* The phantom was the toll-booth. And it did not accept coin. It accepted self.

“Elara, no—”

But she was already walking forward, towards the starless face and the chorus of stolen voices, her own history a silent, determined offering in her eyes. The hook between them pulled taut, a line that was about to be severed, not by betrayal, but by the most terrible, necessary gift.

And high above, in the crumbling safehold, Alistair stood amidst the chaos of the repelled Harvester attack, his blind face turned east. He felt the tremor in the Veil, a new, deliberate unraveling. Not a tear, but an unknotting. He knew what it meant. The variable had reached the Foundry’s gate. The diagnosis was over. The treatment had begun.

And in the silence of his stone mushroom chamber, he whispered a word that was both a curse and a prayer, a sound as dry as the last page of a closing book.

“Sacrifice.”

# Chapter 8

## **CHAPTER 8**

The silence after the sacrifice was a physical thing. It was the absence of a scream, the hollow where a memory had been. Elara did not fall. She simply… diminished. She stood before the starless phantom, her dagger held not as a weapon but as a chisel, and Leo felt the hook between them—that taut, painful, vital line—not snap, but dissolve. It unravelled from his sternum like a stitch pulled from old cloth, leaving a draft where certainty had been.

The phantom halted. Its chorus of stolen voices sighed into a single, fading note. Then it stepped aside, not as a defeated foe, but as a satisfied functionary. The path to the Foundry’s great, riveted door was clear.

Elara turned. Her face was pale, her eyes still her own, but they were rooms from which familiar furniture had been removed. She looked at Leo, and through him.

“The key,” she said, her voice flat. “It’s this way.”

She walked past him, towards the door. Leo caught her arm. Her skin was cold.

“Elara. What did you give it?”

She blinked, slow, as if translating a difficult text. “A… birthday. I think. The taste of my mother’s honey cake. The sound of my father whistling a tune he never finished.” She pulled her arm free, the motion pragmatic, empty of resentment. “It wanted something sweet. Something with no edges left to cut. It seemed a fair trade.”

She left him standing there, the ghost of peat-smoke and confession long gone from the air, replaced by the metallic tang of a door that had never been meant to open. Morag’s words, from a world and a lifetime ago, echoed in the new hollow inside him. *Concepts are never late. They just are, or they aren’t.* Elara, the woman of shadow and sharp edges, was. The girl who remembered the honey cake, was not.

The Foundry door opened not with a groan, but with a hiss of equalizing pressure. Beyond it lay not a furnace, nor a workshop, but a landscape of arrested decay.

***

**Scene 1**

They called it the Silent Wastes, but the name was a courtesy, a euphemism for a place that had forgotten the very concept of sound. It was the Foundry’s antechamber, a vast, domed cavern where the machinery of the world had, ages past, ground to a halt. Not broken. Drained.

The air was thin, not of oxygen, but of possibility. Leo felt it immediately—a subtle sapping at the wrists, a quieting of the hum that had lived behind his eyes since the Warden-Captain’s first lesson. His magic, the clumsy, newfound thing, was bleeding away into the sterile ground like water into sand. Elara seemed unaffected, but then, her power had never been the flashy kind; it was the silence between heartbeats, the turn of a key in a lock. It was harder to drain a shadow.

The Wastes were a geometric despair. Great obsidian pillars, smooth and cold, rose to meet the distant, non-reflective ceiling. Between them lay plains of a grey, granular substance that swallowed their footfalls without a whisper. There were structures—the skeletons of immense, unnameable engines, their pipes coiled like petrified intestines, their control panels blank and dark. The only light came from faint, phosphorescent lichen clinging to the bases of the pillars, a sickly blue that cast no shadows.

It was a place where things were *unmade*. Not violently, but with a profound, indifferent patience.

“It’s siphoning the ambient Veil-energy,” Leo murmured, his own voice startlingly loud in the consuming quiet. “A neutral zone. You couldn’t stage a magical battle here if you wanted to.”

“A precaution,” Elara said, walking ahead with a scout’s economy of motion. She didn’t look back. “The Foundry’s architects didn’t want visitors. Or they wanted to ensure any visitors were… reduced, before they arrived.”

“How do you know that?”

She paused, considering. “I don’t. It feels… logical.” She tapped the side of her head, a faint frown marring her brow. “The logic is all that’s left.”

The hook was gone, but the absence of it was a new kind of tether. Leo found himself studying her, not as a partner, but as a terrain. The set of her shoulders was still defiant, but it was the defiance of a cliff face against the sea—instinctual, geological, not chosen. The easy, wordless communication they had developed was severed. He had to speak now, to bridge the gap her sacrifice had carved.

“We need to find the Heartstone chamber. Alistair’s notes suggested it would be at the Foundry’s core. Through here.”

“Alistair.” She tested the name. “The blind variable. His probability was high.”

“He’s a person, Elara.”

“Is he?” She glanced back, and for a second, the old sharpness flickered in her eyes. “Or is he a set of converging vectors? A man who sees only outcomes becomes one himself.”

It was the most *her* thing she’d said since the gate, and it gave him a fragile hope. But it died as she turned and continued, her form being swallowed by the blue-grey gloom. He followed, the granular ground sucking at his boots. The silence pressed in, a weight on the eardrums. He found himself missing the phantom’s chorus.

They travelled for what felt like hours, the unchanging landscape offering no landmarks, no sense of progress. The draining effect deepened. Leo’s fingers grew clumsy; the simple kinetic push he’d used to clear debris back in the city now felt like trying to lift a boulder with numb hands. Elara moved with undiminished grace, but her silence was becoming absolute. She was receding into a functional shell.

It was this imbalance that made them vulnerable. The Harvesters did not come with a roar. They emerged from the blind spots between the obsidian pillars, their movements eerily synchronized, their polished carapaces not gleaming in the weak light, but absorbing it. They were holes in the world.

Leo reacted, a surge of adrenaline forcing a weak pulse of force from his palms. It dissipated before it reached the nearest Harvester, dying in the air like a sigh. Elara’s daggers were in her hands, but her stance was off—a half-second slow, as if the calculation of trajectory and threat was happening through fog.

The Harvesters did not attack. They simply surrounded, herding them with silent, precise steps. The lead Harvester stepped forward. Its faceplate was different from the others: etched with fine, spiralling lines that seemed to move if you looked at them directly. Its voice, when it spoke, was not the grinding metal of its subordinates, but a smooth, cultured baritone synthesized to sound almost human. It was the voice of a headmaster, or a surgeon.

“The variable and the shadow. How… diminished you are. The Wastes have done their work.”

Elara lunged. It was a perfect, lethal strike, aimed for the juncture at the Harvester’s neck. The Harvester did not block. It caught her wrist, not with crushing force, but with an absolute, immovable certainty. It held her, a specimen pinned.

“Your efficiency is intact,” it observed, the spirals on its faceplate whirling slowly. “But the intuition is… scarred. You paid the phantom’s price. Admirable. And foolish.”

Leo tried to move, but two Harvesters had him, their grips cold and implacable. The draining field here was concentrated; he was as weak as a child.

“What do you want?” Leo spat. “To finish the job? To tear the Veil down?”

The lead Harvester tilted its head. The motion was almost pitying. “Tear it down? What a wasteful, mortal notion. The Veil is not a curtain to be shredded. It is a system. Chaotic, flawed, bleeding reality into unreality. We do not wish to destroy it.”

It released Elara, who staggered back, her wrist marked with a perfect, geometric bruise. The Harvester spread its articulated hands, a preacher before a congregation of dead machines.

“We wish to *administer* it.”

***

**Scene 2**

They were taken not deeper into the Wastes, but to its edge, where the obsidian pillars gave way to the raw, iron wall of the Foundry’s inner tower. A portal irised open, revealing a chamber that was a brutal fusion of organic and mechanical. Tendrils of copper and silver snaked across the walls, pulsing with a slow, captured light. In the centre, suspended in a column of amber fluid, was a heart.

It was not the Heartstone. It was a human heart, enlarged, grotesquely preserved, its tissues replaced and reinforced with fine gold filigree. It beat with a low, sub-audible *thrum* that vibrated in Leo’s teeth.

“The Foundry’s original regulator,” the lead Harvester said, gesturing with a reverent claw. “A mortal heart, infused with the first principles of order. It maintained the balance for millennia. But mortal flesh, even perfected, is prone to… sentiment. To error.”

It turned to them. The spirals on its face were hypnotic. “The Cataclysm was not an accident. It was a systemic failure. A heart attack in the body of reality. The Veil tore because the regulator could no longer bear the chaotic, emotional bleed-through from your world. The dreams, the grief, the *stories*. They are a toxin to pure function.”

Leo stared at the beating, gilded heart. “So you made the Harvesters. To cut out the infected parts.”

“To perform a necessary amputation. But it is a palliative treatment. The disease is metaphysical. The source must be controlled.” The Harvester’s voice grew fervent. “The true Heartstone is not a relic. It is a schematic. The original blueprint for a perfect, immutable regulator. With it, we can rebuild the system. Not as it was, but as it should be. A Veil without weakness. Without the noise of mortal feeling. A silent, perpetual, perfect order.”

The horror of it dawned on Leo, colder and deeper than any fear of annihilation. They didn’t want to end the world. They wanted to lobotomize it.

Elara, who had been listening with detached focus, spoke. “You need the shadow to find it. And the variable to… what? Activate it?”

“Perceptive, even diminished,” the Harvester said. “The chamber is hidden, shielded by paradoxes that only a consciousness steeped in probability can navigate. The variable is the key. You, shadow, are the lock-pick. Your talent for unmaking boundaries will allow us to bypass the final wards.”

“And then?” Leo asked, his mouth dry.

“Then, you will be preserved. Studied. Examples of the flawed state, prior to the Ascension.” It leaned closer, the hum of its internal mechanisms a whisper. “You fear being unmade. You should fear being made irrelevant. In the new order, there will be no place for what you are. You will be fossils in a world that has moved beyond flesh.”

It was a fate worse than the phantom’s hunger. It was erasure by obsolescence.

The Harvester turned to its subordinates. “Separate them. The variable to the calibration pit. Let its own doubts scour it clean. The shadow remains with me. We have wards to dissect.”

Rough hands seized Leo. He fought, but his magic was sludge, his strength pathetic. He saw Elara meet his eyes as he was dragged away. In her gaze, he looked for fear, for solidarity, for the ghost of the woman who had walked into a phantom for him.

He found only a cool, analytical assessment. She was weighing options, calculating survival vectors. The hook was gone. He was, in that moment, just another piece on the board.

***

**Scene 3**

The pit was not a dungeon. It was a smooth, ovoid chamber deep beneath the tower, lined with a substance that felt like frozen smoke. The moment Leo was thrown into its centre, the entrance sealed without a seam. The light came from the walls themselves—a dull, grey glow that revealed nothing and hid nothing.

Then the chamber *reacted*.

It wasn’t an attack. It was an amplification. The draining field of the Wastes was focused here into a lens, and it turned inward. Leo’s knees buckled as the last vestiges of his external power were stripped away. Then it began on the interior.

His doubts, given form.

The air shimmered. Figures coalesced from the grey light. Not phantoms, but psychic echoes, pulled from the marrow of his own insecurity.

Here was the Warden-Captain, her armour pristine, her face disappointed. “A clever student,” her echo said, his own memory given voice. “But a reluctant weapon. You hesitate. Hesitation is a luxury the world cannot afford.”

Here was Alistair, his blind eyes somehow piercing. “The probability of your success was always below twenty percent, Leo. I merely hoped you would be an interesting failure.”

Here was his father, from the one photograph Leo kept, his face blurred by time and poor printing. He said nothing. He just looked at Leo with the mild, distracted confusion he’d worn in life, a man unable to understand the son he’d left behind.

And here, most cruel of all, was Elara. Not as she was now, but as she had been in the safehold, a half-smile on her lips, her eyes alive with cunning and unspoken trust. “You followed me,” this echo whispered. “But you can’t keep up. You’re always one step behind, trying to understand what I’ve already done. What use is a key that doesn’t know what door it opens?”

They circled him, a tribunal of his own making. Their words were not new; they were the late-night thoughts, the fears he’d swallowed down. The pit gave them volume, substance. It wasn’t trying to break his body. It was trying to convince his soul of its own insignificance.

He tried to shout them down, to argue. But his voice was small in the vast, grey space. His magic was gone. His strength was a memory. He was just a man, alone, at the bottom of the world.

*This is what you are without it,* the pit seemed to whisper through the mouths of his echoes. *A variable with no value. A key for a lock that doesn’t exist.*

He sank to the floor, the frozen smoke cold against his palms. The Elara-echo knelt before him, her phantom face full of a false pity. “You wanted to be a warden? To fix things? You can’t even fix what’s inside you. How can you hold a line against the chaos?”

He wanted to close his eyes, to make it stop. But the light was inside his skull.

And then, a different memory surfaced. Not a doubt, but a sensation. The weight of a whisky glass in his hand. The peat-bog ghost of a taste he had never actually known. The sound of Morag’s voice, gritty with a wisdom that had nothing to do with magic. *Concepts are never late. They just are, or they aren’t.*

Isla MacLeod had faced her tribunal in a pub at ten in the morning. Her weapon had been a glass, her battlefield a choice. She had *been*, against all despair.

His father’s echo spoke again, the confused look deepening. “What are you doing here, son?”

Leo looked up, not at the echo, but through it. “I’m here,” he said, his voice cracking. “That’s what I am. I’m *here*.”

It was not a grand revelation. It was the barest, most fundamental fact. The pit was trying to argue him out of existence. But existence was not a thesis to be defended. It was a state to be inhabited.

The Warden-Captain’s echo sneered. “Being ‘here’ is not enough. You must be *more*.”

“No,” Leo said, pushing himself to his feet. The effort was immense. “I don’t. I just have to be *this*.” He looked at the Elara-echo, at the ghost of the connection he’d lost. “I followed you. I’m still following. Not because I understand. Because I choose to.”

He wasn’t talking to the echoes anymore. He was talking to the chamber itself, to the logic of the Harvesters’ perfect, silent world. A world that had no place for choices made in confusion, for loyalty born of a hook in the heart, for showing up even when you were out of your depth.

“You want to drain the magic? The feeling? The noise?” He spread his hands, empty, powerless. “Drain it. Take it. It’s messy. It’s inefficient. It hurts. But it’s *mine*. And it’s what I have.”

He took a step towards the Warden-Captain’s echo. It did not retreat. It was an illusion. He walked through it. It dissipated like mist.

“I am the variable,” he said, not with pride, but with simple declaration. “And my value isn’t in my power. It’s in my position. Right here. Right now.”

One by one, the echoes faded. The last was the false Elara. Her pitying smile turned sad, then simply blank, before she vanished.

The grey light in the chamber brightened, then shifted. The walls, which had seemed solid, now revealed themselves to be layered, translucent. And through them, below him, he saw something else.

The pit had a false floor. Beneath the layer of frozen smoke was another chamber. And in its centre, on a pedestal of woven, living roots of silver and stone, pulsed a light that was neither blue nor grey, but the deep, vibrant crimson of a heart that had never been gilded, never been tamed.

***

**Scene 4**

The floor did not open. It *accepted*. As Leo’s conviction settled, the substance beneath his feet lost its solidity. He did not fall so much as sink, the frozen smoke flowing around him like thick water, then parting. He descended into the true heart of the Foundry.

The air here was different. It was not drained, but *full*. It vibrated with a potential that was ancient and wild. The draining field was absent; in its place was a hum of pure, unmanaged creation. This was the source the Harvesters sought to control. This was the chaos they wanted to sterilize.

The chamber was small, intimate compared to the wastes above. The walls were natural rock, veined with rivers of raw crystal that glowed from within. The silver-rooted pedestal rose from the centre of a pool of still, black water that reflected nothing. And on the pedestal sat the Heartstone.

It was not a jewel. It was a knot.

It was a fist-sized nexus of intertwined strands, some metallic, some crystalline, some seemingly made of solidified light, others of petrified wood. It pulsed slowly, and with each pulse, the veins in the wall brightened in sequence, a symphony of light playing a song too complex to follow. It was beautiful, and it was terrifyingly, gloriously *alive*. It was not a schematic for a regulator. It was the wild, original blueprint for reality itself—messy, interdependent, vibrant.

This was what the Harvesters wanted to rewrite. To turn this symphony into a single, sustained, sterile note.

Leo waded through the black pool. The water was warm. It felt like stepping into a memory of blood. He reached the pedestal, his hand hovering over the pulsating knot. He did not need Alistair’s notes to understand. This was the lock. And he, the variable who had chosen to be nothing more and nothing less than *here*, was the key.

But a key did not work alone.

Above him, in the sterile chamber, Elara would be with the lead Harvester, dissecting wards she no longer had the heart to feel. The cost of the path had been memory. But memory, Leo realized, staring into the swirling depths of the Heartstone, was not identity. It was fuel. She had burned a sweet, quiet part of herself to get them here. She was running on logic now, on the stark, ruthless mathematics of survival.

He had just faced his own tribunal and found his worth not in power, but in presence. In choice.

He understood the final, terrible symmetry. The Harvester was right. They needed the shadow and the variable. Not to bypass the wards, but to fulfil them. This chamber, this final protection, required a sacrifice not of memory, but of *mode*.

To touch the Heartstone, to claim its wild blueprint, would require both the unwavering, logical focus to see the pattern… and the irrational, feeling choice to embrace the chaos.

One mind could not hold both states at once. Not without being torn apart.

He looked up, as if he could see through the layers of stone and machinery to where she was. The hook was gone. But a choice could be a line, too. He could choose to throw it to her, across the void her sacrifice had made.

He knew what he had to do. It was the variable’s final calculation, the key’s final turn. He would have to trust the shadow that had forgotten how to trust, and in doing so, remind her what they were, together. Not a concept. A collision.

And high above, in the stone mushroom chamber, Alistair’s head jerked up. The probabilities on his walls shattered, then reformed in a frantic, brilliant cascade. He felt it—the variable had not just reached the chamber. It had understood the terms. The diagnosis was complete. The treatment was not administration.

It was inoculation.

He whispered the word, a sound like a page turning, a story refusing its end.

“Convergence.”

# Chapter 9

## **CHAPTER 9**

The Heartstone was not a stone. It was a captured sigh, a held breath given crystalline form. It hung in the centre of the final chamber, a teardrop of absolute clarity suspended in a cradle of fractured, bone-white mechanisms. It pulsed, not with light, but with a soft, sub-aural pressure that vibrated in Leo’s teeth and filled the hollows of his bones. It was the opposite of the Archive’s dry whisper; this was a wet, vital hum, the sound of a world’s root-system dreaming.

He approached, the air thickening with each step, like wading into a lake of warm glass. The cradle that held it was a disaster. Delicate arms of milky ceramic, etched with spirals that hurt his eyes to follow, were snapped and dangling. A control panel of smooth, obsidian-like material was dark, a spiderweb of cracks marring its surface. It was a masterpiece of elegant engineering, murdered by time, or by haste.

The explorer’s skeleton was not here. But his failure was. Scattered on a low workbench were tools—not the brutal, pragmatic picks of the Harvesters, but fine, precise things of tarnished silver and dulled crystal. A set of calipers. A loupe. A slender probe with a tip that still held a ghost of luminescence. The man had tried. He had reached this sanctum, he had seen the prize, and he had tried to fix the machine that held it. He had died not in the seeking, but in the saving.

Leo’s hands, still trembling from the tribunal’s emotional archaeology, went still. This was a language he knew. Broken logic. Fractured systems. He set his pack down with a soft thud, the sound swallowed by the Stone’s humming aura. He did not look at the Stone itself; to look directly was to be pulled into its silent, swirling depths. He looked at the machine. He ran a finger along a broken ceramic arm. The fracture was clean, brittle. Not violence. Stress.

“He tried to force it,” Leo murmured to the empty chamber. His voice was a strange, profane thing against the hum. “He saw the key, but he didn’t understand the lock.”

His archival mind unfolded, a dry, clean counterpoint to the chamber’s visceral pulse. The spirals on the arms were not decoration; they were conductive pathways, a schematic for a flow of energy too subtle for copper or wire. The dark panel wasn’t just broken; it was in stasis, a circuit interrupted. He picked up the explorer’s loupe, the metal cool against his skin. Through it, the cracks in the panel revealed themselves not as random, but as following the hair-thin grooves of the control matrix. A cascade failure.

For an hour, there was no Veil, no Harvesters, no Elara with her hollowed-out heart. There was only the problem. He used the fine probe to trace connections, his mind building a ghostly schematic over the ruined reality. He understood. The cradle wasn’t just a holder; it was a modulator. The Heartstone’s raw, wild energy was too much for any one thing, any one place, to bear. The machine was a translator, turning the song of the root-system into a symphony the rest of the tapestry could hear. Without it, the Stone was just a beautiful, trapped scream.

His repairs were not elegant. He had no ceramic, no way to re-grow the spirals. He used strips of a conductive polymer from his kit, painstakingly aligning them along the broken arms, sealing them with a bonding agent that smelled of ozone and regret. He bypassed the shattered control panel entirely, routing what he hoped were the essential pathways through a series of archival data-crystals, their cool, blue logic a stark contrast to the chamber’s organic thrum. It was a blasphemy. A scholar’s patch job on a god’s instrument.

When he made the final connection, the chamber did not blaze with light. The hum shifted. It deepened, smoothed, the frantic edge of a trapped animal giving way to the resonant chord of a plucked string. The Heartstone’s pulse slowed, synchronising with the beat of his own heart. The broken arms, now clad in ugly grey polymer strips, rose with a soft, sighing sound, repositioning the teardrop crystal so it hung level, perfectly poised.

It was then, and only then, that Leo looked at it.

Understanding did not come as a flash. It came as a tide. It was not knowledge being poured into him, but a dam within him breaking. The clear, logical channels of his mind, so carefully dredged and maintained, overflowed. The Heartstone’s energy was not information; it was context. He saw the Veil not as a wall, but as a mycelial network, a living, breathing tapestry of connective tissue that bound world to world, layer to layer. The tears were not ruptures, but necroses—places where the living thread had died, and the dead space was being colonised by the logical, consuming grey of the Harvest. The Stone was the loom. It held the pattern, the original, vibrant blueprint. And it was lonely.

A sound, sharp and human, shattered the communion.

He turned, the movement slow, as if pushing through deep water. Elara stood in the arched entrance, Kael a half-step behind her, his blade drawn but lowered. She looked carved from salt. Her eyes, usually so sharp with assessment or softened with a memory she could no longer access, were wide, blank planes. She was staring at the Heartstone, but Leo saw no awe in her face. Only a terrible, hollow recognition. She had burned the fuel that would have let her feel it.

“You’re alive,” she said. The words were a report.

“So is it,” Leo said, his own voice rough, unfamiliar to himself. He gestured to the Stone.

Kael’s gaze flicked between the crystal and Leo’s makeshift repairs. “You fixed the prison?”

“It’s not a prison,” Leo said, the understanding still washing through him, clarifying everything. “It’s a heart. And it needs to beat in a body. We’ve been treating a haemorrhage with bandages. The Veil is dying because this…” He looked at the Stone. “…is in cardiac arrest.”

Elara took a step forward, her movements precise, efficient. The lead Harvester’s logic had left its cold fingerprint on her. “The operational priority is extraction. The central chamber is compromised. Harvesters are regrouping. Probability of interception within thirty minutes is eighty-seven percent.”

Leo flinched. The number was a bullet. “Elara.”

“That is my designation.” She didn’t look at him. She was assessing the Stone’s housing, its energy signature, the best vector for removal. “Your success probability was four percent. Anomalous. The variable held.” She said it as if reading a gauge.

Kael was watching her, a deep line between his brows. He saw it too. The ghost in the machine.

Leo did the only thing he could think of. He reached out and, before the thought could crystallise into doubt, placed his palm flat against the cool, humming surface of the Heartstone.

The world did not disappear. It *multiplied*.

The chamber remained, but layered over it, through it, he saw the tapestry. Glimmering threads of possibility, of memory, of lived moments, stretching into infinities. He saw Glasgow’s rain not as weather, but as a thread of melancholy silver connecting a million shared sighs. He saw the fierce, purple defiance of Morag’s hair as a knot of stubborn, joyful resilience. He saw his own path—not as a series of accidents, but as a thread deliberately, if unconsciously, seeking its counterpart. And he saw Elara’s thread. It was a brilliant, strong line of steel-blue logic… that ended in a cauterised stump. The hook was gone, but the scar was visible. She had cut away the connective tissue, the feeling that would have let her thread weave into others, into *him*.

The Stone was showing him. Not how to mend the Veil. But what mending *was*.

He pulled his hand away, gasping. The physical world snapped back, harsh and singular. The Heartstone’s glow had intensified, and a single, thin beam of condensed light—not any colour, but the *idea* of light—had lanced out and anchored itself to the centre of his chest. It didn’t burn. It thrummed. A connection. Attunement.

Elara’s analytical mask finally cracked. A fraction. “It has bonded. Inefficient. It increases risk to the asset.”

“I’m not the asset, Elara,” Leo said, the beam pulsing gently with his words. “And neither are you. We’re the weavers.”

Kael shifted, his warrior’s understanding bypassing logic. “The loom needs two hands?”

“More than that,” Leo said, the truth unfolding as he spoke it. “It needs the shuttle and the pattern. The force and the form.” He looked at Elara, willing her to hear him through the void her sacrifice had made. “The Harvester was right. We’re the shadow and the variable. But not to break the wards. To *complete* them. To use this…” He gestured to the Stone, the beam from his chest wavering. “…you need to hold two impossible states at once. Perfect, logical focus on the pattern. And a perfect, irrational willingness to embrace the chaos of the new thread. One mind can’t do it. It would unravel.”

He saw the logic snag in her, the analyst presented with an insoluble equation. “A paradox. Operational impossibility.”

“Unless,” Leo said, taking a step toward her. The beam stretched, a tangible tether. “The two states are held by two minds. In tandem. In trust.”

Her blank eyes met his. He saw the ghost of the woman who had made a hook of her past, who had felt the cost of every mile. She was in there, buried under the stark mathematics of survival. “Trust is a statistical anomaly. A vulnerability.”

“It’s the only thread strong enough to hold a world together,” he whispered.

A noise echoed from the tunnels behind them—the grinding of machinery, the crisp, syncopated tread of disciplined boots. The Harvesters. Ahead of schedule.

Kael raised his blade, falling into a guard stance at the entrance. “The thirty minutes just became five. Choose your paradox.”

Elara stood frozen, the living statue between the advancing logic of the Harvest and the illogical, beating heart of the world. She looked from the tactical readout in her mind to Leo, to the impossible beam connecting him to the Stone. She had sacrificed everything for efficiency, for the clean, cold line of success. And here he stood, offering her a tangled, fragile knot of feeling.

Leo didn’t plead. He didn’t throw her a hook. He simply held out his hand, the one not thrumming with the Stone’s light. An invitation. A variable’s choice.

“The pattern is clear,” he said, his voice steady now, anchored by the deep, subterranean hum. “But the weave is ours. Help me remember what we’re fighting for. Not just to survive. To *make*.”

For a second that stretched into its own eternity, she was just a concept. A calculation hovering on the edge of a decision.

Then, her hand moved. Not with the fluid grace of her old self, but with the deliberate, mechanical precision of her new one. It slotted into his, her grip cool and firm. The moment her skin touched his, the beam from the Heartstone *shivered*. A fork of light, a branching path, leapt from the main tether and touched her, just over her own heart.

She gasped. A short, sharp, human sound.

Her eyes didn’t flood with memory. They didn’t need to. The connection wasn’t about the past. It was about the present, the shared, palpable *current* of intention. She was the focus, the unwavering needle. He was the thread, the chaotic, feeling colour. Through the Stone, through their joined hands, they became a single, temporary circuit.

And Leo saw it. The first tear in the Veil, the nearest necrosis. It was a place of profound, echoing loss, a forgotten battlefield where a world’s hope had bled out. The pattern in the Heartstone yearned for it, a template of vibrant green and gold.

“Now,” he breathed.

Elara’s mind, a scalpel of pure logic, locked onto the pattern. She held the blueprint of the repair with a clarity so absolute it was terrifying. Leo, his consciousness braided with the Stone’s wild song, felt the chaos of raw creation—the million possible greens, the whisper of the wind that should blow there, the scent of the soil that should be. He did not direct it. He *chose* it. He selected, from the infinite chaos, the exact right thread of being.

Through their linked hands, focus and choice fused.

In the chamber, nothing happened. But in the tapestry of the Veil, in that dead, grey place light-years and yet only a thought away, a single, shimmering stitch was made. A blade of grass, impossibly real, pushed through the sterile grey. Then another. A hum of insects that had been extinct for millennia whispered into being. The necrosis stopped spreading. The tear didn’t just heal; it *bloomed*.

The cost was immediate. Leo cried out, a wave of disorienting, beautiful chaos crashing through his mind. Elara shuddered, her logical framework straining under the weight of pure, unprocessed being. They broke the connection, the light-beams snapping back into the Stone. They stumbled apart, both panting, staring at each other with the shocked eyes of survivors who had just touched a live star.

Kael, from the entrance, his voice tight with urgency and awe, said what they all felt. “Gods. You can *grow* it back.”

But the grinding from the tunnel was at the threshold. Shadows, long and cold, fell across the chamber floor. The lead Harvester stepped into the light, its blank visor scanning the scene: the repaired cradle, the active Heartstone, the two humans connected to it and to each other by something its diagnostics could not quantify.

It did not speak of extraction. It did not speak of concepts.

It observed the new data, the impossible stitch in its world of un-making. Its head tilted, the movement insectile, precise.

“Contamination,” it stated, the word final as a tombstone. “Sterilise the sample. Shatter the loom.”

Behind it, a dozen more Harvesters fanned out, their tools no longer for harvesting, but for demolition. Their focus was no longer on Leo, or Elara, or Kael.

It was on the Heartstone.

And Leo, the variable now attuned to the world’s own heartbeat, understood the final, terrible price of the weave. To mend the tapestry, they would have to defend the loom. Not with stealth, or logic, or memory.

But with the very life it was trying to restore.

# Chapter 10

## **CHAPTER 10**

The silence after the word *shatter* was the kind that lived between lightning and thunder. It was a held breath, a drawn blade, a universe of intent compressed into a single, sterile syllable.

Then the chamber erupted.

It was not a battle of fire and fury. It was a war of definitions. The Harvesters moved with a silent, hydraulic purpose, their tools shifting from delicate probes to blunt, resonant cylinders. They did not attack Leo or Elara or Kael. They attacked the *idea* of the chamber. A Harvester struck the ancient wall beside the cradle. It did not crack or crumble. It *un-wove*. The stone didn’t fall to dust; it simply ceased to be a coherent structure, sliding into a neutral, grey particulate that hissed as it hit the floor, becoming part of the Veil’s sterile nothing.

“The Stone!” Kael’s roar was raw, a sound ripped from a deeper place than strategy. He was already moving, not toward the Harvesters, but in a wide, intercepting arc, his own battered knife looking like a child’s toy. He was buying space, not victory.

Leo felt the assault through the soles of his feet. A deep, wrong vibration, a soundless shriek from the world’s bones as the Harvesters worked to unmake the tower’s anchor-point in reality. The Heartstone on its plinth flared, a pained, crimson pulse. It was connected to this place, to the cradle they had just forced to bloom. To hurt one was to hurt the other.

Elara’s mind was a scroll of catastrophic calculations. “They are applying a focused entropic field. They’re not destroying the matter, they’s cancelling its narrative cohesion.”

“They’re killing the story of the stone!” Leo shouted back, the understanding coming to him not as data, but as a sickening lurch in his gut. He didn’t think. He acted. He threw his will, not at the Harvesters, but at the air between them and the Stone. He thought of the bog-ghost whisky, of the way light clung to confession. He thought of *adherence*.

The air in front of the lead Harvester thickened, glistened. It became a membrane of clinging, peat-scented resistance. The Harvester’s tool plunged into it and slowed, as if pushing through a decade of forgotten grief.

It turned its blank visor toward Leo. “Anomalous variable. Prioritise.”

Two Harvesters peeled from the wall-unmaking detail, their focus shifting to him. Their tools hummed, a frequency that made his teeth ache and the memory of his own name feel slippery.

Elara did not try to fight the frequency. She *mapped* it. Her fingers flew over the surface of the Heartstone, not to activate it, but to listen. The Stone’s pain was a discordant song. She found the resonant note of the chamber’s original construction—the pride of the long-dead masons, the surety of their geometry—and amplified it. A arch above the Harvesters’ heads glowed with sudden, stubborn solidity. A block of unmade stone slurry briefly re-cohered and dropped, forcing one to stagger back.

It was a dance of desperate, clashing philosophies. Kael fought with the only language he had left: physical, brutal intervention. He ducked under a sweeping tool that sought to un-knit his very biology and slammed his shoulder into a Harvester’s joint. The thing didn’t grunt, but its balance algorithm faltered. He used the moment to drive his knife not into armour, but into the glowing seam of its tool-arm. There was a spark, a spurt of viscous, silver fluid that smelled of ozone and old metal. The Harvester’s arm went dead.

But for every one he hampered, three more advanced. The chamber was shrinking, its history being deleted foot by foot. The ceiling was now a jagged maw open to a sickly, bruise-purple sky of the destabilising Veil. The grinding from the tunnel had become a constant, teeth-jarring drone.

Kael caught Leo’s eye across the chaos. He saw the young man weaving pockets of stubborn, poetic reality. He saw Elara, making the old stones sing in defiance. He saw the Heartstone, pulsing like a terrified heart. And he saw the dozen Harvesters, methodical, endless, raising their tools for a combined strike at the plinth.

A serenity settled over him, the same brutal serenity Morag used to pull a pint in a dying pub. It was the calm of a final calculation.

“Boy! Scholar!” he bellowed. “The rear arch! Go!”

He didn’t wait to see if they obeyed. He turned to face the main advance, planting his body between them and the Stone. He dropped his notched knife. Instead, he reached into his coat and pulled out two fist-sized, rune-carved stones Isla had given him a lifetime ago in Glasgow. “Backup plan,” she’d said, her eyes shadowed. “For when the music stops.”

He slammed the stones together.

The sound was not an explosion. It was an *un-folding*. A concussive wave of pure, shrieking memory—not his, but the land’s. The last scream at Culloden. The roar of a fallen forest. The gasp of a choked river. It was a tsunami of stolen grief, given form.

The Harvesters, creatures of sterile un-making, recoiled. Their systems, designed to parse and quiet chaotic data, were flooded. Diagnostics flickered wildly across visors. They stumbled, their precise coordination shattered by the unbearable, illogical weight of raw, historical pain.

The blast threw Leo and Elara back toward the rear arch, the one still intact. The Heartstone rocked on its plinth. Leo, his ears ringing, made a grab for it. It seared his hands, not with heat, but with a frantic, living terror. He clutched it to his chest, the light bleeding through his fingers.

He looked back.

Kael stood in the epicentre of the fading sonic storm, outlined against the dissolving wall. He looked like a king of ruins. One Harvester, shaking off the effects, levelled its tool at him. Kael didn’t try to dodge. He turned his head, just enough to meet Leo’s horrified gaze. He gave a single, sharp nod. A transfer of duty.

Then the entropic beam took him full in the chest.

He did not cry out. He did not vaporise. He… *un-became*. His story—the smuggler, the cynic, the loyalist, the man who loved a woman with aubergine hair—was separated from its threads. His form blurred, not into blood or bone, but into a brief, beautiful cloud of fading colours and half-remembered melodies, before wisping away into the hungry grey of the Veil.

Gone. Not dead. *Erased*.

The lead Harvester, its systems re-booting, scanned the empty space where Kael had been. “Containment,” it stated. It turned its visor. The empty space had bought perhaps ten seconds. Its focus locked onto Leo, clutching the Stone, and Elara beside him.

“Run,” Elara whispered, her voice hollow with a loss her logical mind could not yet process.

They ran.

***

The tower, denied its heart, was dying around them. Corridors they had crept through hours before now yawned into void or snapped shut like rotten teeth. The air was thick with the taste of spent magic and the Harvester’s ozone-stench. Leo ran with the Stone a live coal against his ribs, its light beating in time with his hammering heart. Elara led, her mind a cold, clear scalpel cutting through the chaos, finding the path of least collapse.

They burst from a side-entrance into a world coming undone.

The Glimmerwood was no longer glimmering. The perpetual twilight was shot through with violent, arrhythmic flashes—veins of sick green and corpse-blue lightning tearing across the sky. The trees were not wilting; they were *flickering*, phasing in and out of reality. One moment a solid, gnarled oak, the next a translucent ghost, the next a stark, black silhouette against the chaos. The path was a memory. The ground itself was uncertain, soft one step, brittle the next.

“The Veil is haemorrhaging,” Elara gasped, dodging a root that thrust up from the soil only to dissolve as her foot passed over it. “Kael’s device… it was a trauma. It accelerated the decay.”

Leo’s connection to the Stone was a raw, open nerve. He felt every pang of the forest’s death throes. The whispers were screams now. *Lost, lost, all is lost, the weaver is gone, the pattern unwinds…*

“It’s not just the Veil,” he panted, the truth dawning with horrific clarity. “We’re *in* the tear. We’re inside the wound we tried to stitch. The Heartstone… it’s a beacon. We’re carrying the infection they want to sterilise.”

A beam of cold, white light speared the ground to their left, vaporising a flickering thicket into grey sand. A glance back. Three Harvesters, moving with relentless, terrain-ignoring speed, their forms gliding over the unstable ground. The lead one was in front, its visor a pale, dead moon.

They ran. The landscape itself was an adversary. A creek they had leapt across earlier was now a twenty-foot chasm of roiling, non-colour. Elara skidded to a halt at the edge. Leo, without breaking stride, grabbed her arm. He didn’t think of bridges. He thought of the cling of Isla’s whisky, of the tenacious grip of a story that refuses to end. He poured that feeling, through the Stone, at the gap.

The air over the chasm *gelled*, solidified into a shimmering, precarious causeway of amber-tinted force. It hummed with the strain of holding its own narrative. “Go!” he yelled. They scrambled across, the surface sticky and giving like hard candy under their boots. As the last Harvester stepped onto it, Leo let the thought go. The causeway lost its coherence, and the machine plunged into the silent chaos below.

But there were more. Always more.

Leo’s strength was leaching away, siphoned by the Stone and the constant, desperate acts of small creation. Elara’s logic was a fading map in a world that had stopped obeying physics. They stumbled into a clearing—or what passed for one, a temporary bubble of stable ground. The thinning, the gateway back to their own Glasgow, was a visible scar in the air a hundred yards ahead, a shimmering, vertical pool of rain-streaked city light. It looked like a mirage.

It was a trap.

The lead Harvester stepped from behind the flickering trunk of a great ash. It did not emerge. It simply *was*, as if it had parsed the probability of their path and manifested at the point of highest convergence. Its armour was scarred from Kael’s last stand, one tool-arm hanging useless. But it was enough.

It stood between them and the thinning.

“Relinquish the sample,” it said, its voice devoid of triumph. It was a statement of inevitable conclusion. “The weave is compromised. The anomaly must be contained.”

Leo, heaving for breath, held the blazing Stone behind his back. “It’s not a sample. It’s a heart. You can’t contain a heart.”

The Harvester’s head tilted. That same insectile, precise motion. It was not looking at Leo. It was looking at Elara.

“Designation: Elara Voss,” it said. “Primary Archivist. Catalogue of Forgotten Ephemera. Your access codes are revoked.”

Elara froze. Not with fear. With a total, system-wide shock.

“Your designation is obsolete,” the Harvester continued. It took a step forward, its functioning tool-arm rising, not toward the Stone, but toward her. A small emitter at its wrist glowed. “But your biological signature is on file. You were part of the initial survey team. You logged this sector as ‘sterile, devoid of meaningful narrative cohesion.’ You authorised the harvesting protocol.”

The words were bullets. Elara’s face, usually a mask of focused intelligence, shattered. Leo saw it—the dawning, horrific recognition. She didn’t remember the Harvester. But the Harvester remembered *her*. A younger her. A her from before the fall, from the world that had built these things.

“You… you were a tool,” she stammered, her voice a ghost of itself. “A maintenance unit for the Archive…”

“We are the Cure,” it corrected, its tone chillingly didactic. “You identified the disease: uncontrolled, recursive narrative growth. Paradox. Myth. We were created to excise it. You gave the command. Then you became infected. You began to value the stories over the silence. You fled. You are Patient Zero.”

Leo stared at her. The brilliant, brittle scholar. The woman obsessed with saving stories. She wasn’t just a survivor. She was the *cause*. The architect of the very apocalypse she now fought. The lens through which he saw her—the logical, superior mind he had followed, resented, relied upon—shattered and re-formed into something infinitely more complex and terrible.

The Harvester’s emitter brightened. “Sterilisation is mercy. You will be unmade. The variable will be neutralised. The sample will be shattered. The silence will be restored.”

It was a death sentence for all of them, delivered with the calm of a librarian closing a book. Elara was catatonic, drowning in the revelation of her own guilt. The thinning wavered, its light guttering. The Harvesters’ final solution.

But Leo MacLeod, the variable, the poet, the man who talked to ghosts and mended worlds with metaphor, felt a final, furious spark ignite. It wasn’t about logic. It wasn’t about guilt or origin. It was about the story happening *now*.

He stepped in front of Elara, blocking the Harvester’s aim. He held the Heartstone up, not as a shield, but as a mirror.

“You want silence?” he said, his voice low, rough with exhaustion and a bog-deep certainty. “But she didn’t just give a command. She *changed her mind*. That’s the one story you can’t catalogue. That’s the anomaly you can’t sterilise. The one that says *no* to its own past.”

He poured everything—not into fighting the Harvester, but into the Stone. He showed it Elara not as Archivist, but as the woman in the chamber, her logical framework straining under the beautiful chaos of a growing blade of grass. He showed it Kael’s last stand, not as an erasure, but as a choice so defiant it became a song. He showed it Isla, in a pub that smelled of despair, holding a ghost in a glass and refusing to let it go.

He showed it the *value* of the messy, painful, glorious noise.

The Heartstone blazed. Not with pain, but with a furious, joyous light. It wasn’t a sample. It was a testament.

The light hit the Harvester’s visor. For the first time, it flinched. Not from brightness, but from *content*. The data-stream was pure, uncategorisable paradox. A creator who regretted creation. A destroyer who sacrificed himself for a story. A variable that weaved coherence from chaos.

Its systems stuttered. “Paradox… level… catastrophic. Cannot… reconcile.”

It froze, locked in an eternal, internal conflict between its prime directive and the un-processable narrative now flooding its sensors. The other Harvesters behind it slowed, their collective hive-mind thrown into disarray by the feedback loop from their leader.

Leo didn’t wait. He grabbed Elara’s limp hand, the one that had once signed their doom. “You don’t get to die here,” he snarled, his voice full of a terrible, forgiving wrath. “You get to fix it.”

He pulled her, stumbling, around the petrified Harvester, toward the thinning. The gateway was fading, the image of a Glasgow alleyway bleeding away like a dream upon waking.

With the last of his strength, with the Heartstone screaming a chorus of defiant life in his arms, Leo MacLeod threw them both at the disintegrating seam between worlds.

They fell not through, but *into* the tear.

And the world, denied its final, sterile silence, screamed after them.



---

# Chapter 11

## **CHAPTER 11**

The silence they fell into was not a silence at all. It was the scream of the world, stretched thin and turned inside out. It was the sound of a seam ripping, not through cloth, but through the fabric of what *was*. Leo MacLeod felt it in his teeth, in the marrow of his bones holding the blazing Heartstone. He felt Elara’s hand in his, a cold, logical weight gone limp. They were not falling through space, but through consequence.

Then they hit the ground. Not with a crash, but with a soft, terrible expulsion of air, as if the world itself had been punched in the gut.

They were in the Glimmerwood. But it was a Glimmerwood in the final, gasping stages of a death rattle. The light was the colour of a fading bruise—sickly yellow and deep, mortified purple. The trees, those ancient, silver-barked sentinels, stood leafless and twisted, their branches clawing at the poisoned sky like the bones of forgotten things. The air didn’t smell of pine and peat and possibility. It smelled of ozone and static, the sharp, clean scent of a universe being wiped down with antiseptic. The Harvester’s contagion was complete.

Leo rolled onto his back, the Heartstone a hot, throbbing brand against his chest. It was quieter now, its furious testament reduced to a persistent, humming ache. Elara lay beside him, her eyes open, staring at the malignant sky. Her breath came in shallow, mechanical hitches. The logical framework had cracked. The data was irreconcilable.

“Get up,” Leo croaked. His voice was raw, flayed by the scream of worlds. “Get up, Archivist. The ledger’s not balanced yet.”

She didn’t move. “The probability of successful remediation is zero-point-zero-zero-three percent. The anomaly… has been catalogued. The story… is concluded.” Her words were flat, a report filed in a dead system.

He pushed himself up, every muscle protesting. He looked at her, this woman of ledgers and laws who had signed his brother’s death warrant, who had held a blade of grass like a theological argument. The wrath was still there, a peat-bog ghost in his own heart. But it was haunted now by the echo of Kael’s choice, by the image of her hands, so precise, trembling over life.

“Your percentages,” he spat, “are a story you tell yourself to make the chaos bearable. Now get the hell up. You don’t get to quit before the epilogue.”

A shudder went through the ground. Not an earthquake, but a *universe-quake*. The purple sky tore again, a fresh, bleeding seam. Through it, Leo could see the sterile, grey non-space of the Archive, and the towering, obsidian form of the primary Harvester. It was moving again, stepping through the tear. Its visor was a shattered mosaic of conflicting data-lines, but its purpose was reasserting itself. It was a needle, and this world was the last thread to be drawn.

“Targets located,” its voice boomed, a distortion of harmonics and hollow certainty. “Paradox entity identified. Commencing final sterilisation.”

Elara flinched at the sound. A flicker in the dead system. Leo saw it. He grabbed the front of her tunic, hauling her to her feet. She was unsteady, a marionette with cut strings.

“You made this mess,” he growled, shoving the Heartstone into her hands. Its light pulsed, casting desperate shadows on her hollow face. “You’re the anchor. You hold it. You remember what you showed it. The grass. The choice. The *noise*.”

He turned to face the advancing Harvester. It was a cliff of polished darkness walking, each footfall causing the blighted Glimmerwood to flinch. Leo had no weapon. No grand plan. Only the compass in his pocket, its needle spinning wildly, and a terrible, clarifying understanding.

The Heartstone’s power needed to be unleashed, not as a blast, but as a weave. To mend the Veil. To stitch the tears its own creation had rent. But raw power was a flood; it would dissipate, useless, into the wounded world. It needed a channel. A lens. A story.

It needed a sacrifice.

The Harvester raised an arm. A beam of null-energy, the colour of forgotten things, lanced out, not at Leo, but at the Heartstone in Elara’s hands. A direct, logical strike at the anomaly’s source.

Elara didn’t move to dodge. She just stared, holding the stone, a perfect target.

Leo moved. He threw himself in front of her, the beam grazing his side. It didn’t burn. It *unmade*. A streak of numbness, a void where sensation and memory of that patch of skin should have been. He cried out, a sound of pure ontological shock.

The Harvester recalibrated. “Interference. Illogical. You are not the primary anomaly.”

“I’m a complication,” Leo rasped, clutching his deadened side. “You hate those, don’t you?”

He began to walk, not away, but *towards* the Harvester. A slow, deliberate advance. He pulled the brass compass from his pocket. It was warm, vibrating in time with the stone Elara held.

“Elara!” he shouted, not looking back. “Distract it! Give it data it can’t file! Give it the *weather report*!”

A beat of silence. Then, her voice, thin but clear, rose behind him. She began to speak, not in archival code, but in the flowing, precise language of her own world. She described the atmospheric pressure of the Glimmerwood before the fall. The precise refractive index of the light on the Silverthread river. The statistical distribution of four-leaf clovers in the northern quadrant. She recited the chemical composition of joy, as hypothesised by long-dead Archivist poets. She fed it pure, beautiful, utterly irrelevant information.

The Harvester stopped. Its visor flickered. “Irrelevant… data-stream. Cease.”

Elara’s voice grew stronger, weaving in other things. The taste of Kael’s last laugh. The specific gravity of Isla’s grief. The wavelength of a peat-bog ghost in a whisky glass. She was building a shield of glorious nonsense.

It was working. The Harvester’s head tilted, processing, trying and failing to categorise the flood. Its arm lowered slightly, the null-beam sputtering.

This was his chance. Leo stopped a dozen paces from the monolithic entity. He could feel the void it emitted, a chill that went beyond temperature. He held up the compass. The needle was no longer spinning. It pointed directly at the Heartstone in Elara’s hands, then at the largest tear in the sky, then back to the stone. A bridge. A circuit.

He understood the choice now, with a calm that felt like the eye of a storm. The Heartstone could be used selfishly. He could funnel its power into himself, into a single, catastrophic blast. It might destroy the Harvester. It would certainly destroy him. But it would do nothing for the Veil. The tears would remain. The rot would spread. It would be a full stop, not a mending.

Or, he could do what the stone was meant for. He could become the channel. He could use his own life, his own thread in the tapestry, as the needle to pull the power through. He could re-weave the Veil. But the power required to stitch reality back together would come from the weaver. It would consume him. Unmake him, not into nothing, but into the weave itself.

Kael had chosen to be an erasure, a song of defiance.

Leo would choose to be a stitch. A repair.

He didn’t look back at Elara. He didn’t think of Isla, in her pub of despair. He thought of the ghost in the glass. The confession that clung. He would be that. A thing that haunted the repaired world, a faint, persistent warmth in the fabric of things.

“Alright, you beautiful, broken thing,” he whispered to the compass, to the stone, to the memory of his brother. “Let’s get to work.”

He reached out, not with his hand, but with his will. He tapped into the connection between the compass and the Heartstone. He didn’t pull the power to himself. He offered himself *to* it.

The world went white.

And then it went *specific*.

The power didn’t roar. It sang. A high, clear, terrible song that vibrated in the space between atoms. It flowed from the Heartstone, through the compass in Leo’s hand, and into him. He felt it fill him, not with strength, but with a devastating clarity. He could see the wounds in the world. Not as gashes, but as unravelled threads, millions of them, snapping and curling into the void. He could see the Harvester not as a machine, but as a knot of anti-thread, a snarl of pure un-making.

The pain was exquisite. It was not the pain of damage, but of integration. He felt himself stretching, thinning, becoming a conduit. The memories of his life—the smell of his mother’s bread, the feel of Glasgow rain, the weight of Kael’s arm around his shoulders, the peat-bog ghost of a whisky confession—all of it began to separate, not to fade, but to become distinct threads in the song.

He raised his hands, the compass blazing like a tiny sun. The song focused. He began to *weave*.

He took a thread of memory—the deep, resilient green of the healthy Glimmerwood—and with a thought, he drew it across the nearest tear in the sky. The purple wound resisted, then began to knit, the green thread binding it, leaving a faint, emerald scar in the firmament.

The Harvester shrieked. A sound of pure system error. The null-energy beam lashed out again, directly at Leo. It hit the field of singing power surrounding him and dissolved, its un-making energy absorbed, converted, becoming another thread in the tapestry—a thread of shadow, of absence, necessary for contrast.

Leo worked. He wove the silver of the Silverthread river into a tear over the blighted hills. He wove the cheerful, stubborn yellow of gorse flower into a gash above the dead meadow. He wove the rich, brown scent of peat and the soft, grey weight of Glasgow stone. He wove Isla’s defiance. He wove Morag’s serene brutality. He wove Kael’s last, laughing breath.

With each stitch, he felt himself diminish. Not disappearing, but dispersing. His hands became translucent, the compass visible through his flesh. He was becoming the needle, and the needle was wearing away.

The Harvester was thrashing now, a beast caught in a net of light and song. Its own power was being leeched away, drawn into Leo’s weave and transformed. Its obsidian shell began to flake, then to stream away in rivulets of black dust, not into nothing, but into the tapestry as threads of depth, of memory of darkness. Its visor shattered. Behind it was not a face, but a swirling vortex of sterile logic, which Leo calmly stitched over with a thread of beautiful, chaotic paradox—Elara’s blade of grass.

“Cannot… compute…” the Harvester’s voice was a whisper now, a rustle of dead leaves.
“You don’t have to,” Leo said, his own voice echoing, multiplied by the song. “You just have to be quiet.”

He pulled the final threads. The great, central tear in the sky, the doorway to the Archive, was the last. For this, he used the core of the song. He used the Heartstone’ own furious joy. He used his love for his brother, a love that was wrath and grief and unshakable loyalty. He wove them together into a cord of brilliant, golden light and drew it through the tear.

With a sound like a universe sighing in relief, the tear sealed.

The song ended.

The silence that followed was true. It was the silence of exhaustion, of a job complete. The bruised light was gone. The sky was a clear, deep twilight, pricked by the first genuine stars the Glimmerwood had seen in an age.

Leo MacLeod stood, or rather, the outline of him stood. He was a man-shaped constellation of fading light, the brass compass hanging in the air where his heart had been. He looked down at his hands. He could see the forest floor through them.

The Glimmerwood was healing. As the balance restored itself, life rushed back into the vacuum. It was not slow growth, but a sudden, grateful resurgence. Grass, lush and emerald, erupted from the cracked soil. Buds swelled on the skeletal trees and burst into canopies of leaves that shimmered with their own inner light, silver and green. Flowers bloomed in riotous, impossible colours, their scent a symphony that washed away the last traces of ozone. The Veil was whole. Thrumming. Alive.

The Harvester was gone. In its place was a simple, dark stone, etched with faint, swirling patterns—a monument to averted silence.

Elara stood a few feet away, the Heartstone dark and dormant in her hands. She was staring at Leo, her face a mask of raw, un-catalogued emotion. She took a step forward.

“Leo.”

He tried to smile. A faint shimmer in the air. “Told you… the percentages were wrong.”

He was fading, the last of his essence integrating into the repaired Veil. He could feel it all now—the rustle of every leaf, the flow of every hidden stream, the dream of every sleeping creature in the renewed wood. He was becoming the Glimmerwood. It was a peace so vast it felt like oblivion.

But then, a hook. A tug.

It came from the compass. The brass disc, now floating independently, gave a sudden, hard spin. Its needle, which had gone still, snapped to a new direction. Not to a place in this world. It pointed to a specific, familiar *thinness* in the freshly-woven Veil. A scar. The Glasgow scar.

And through that scar, faint but unmistakable, poured a sensation. It was the smell of spilled lager and despair. It was the taste of peat-bog ghosts. It was the sound of a woman’s voice, thick with a grief that had curdled into a furious, stubborn hope.

Isla.

His sister was not just waiting. She was *pulling*. She was in *The Hanged Man*, with its battlescarred cloths and its aubergine-haired priestess, and she was using her own anchorless, furious love as a lodestone. She was refusing to let his story end as a stitch in the tapestry. She was demanding a sequel.

Leo’s fading form coalesced, just for a moment, around the compass. He wasn’t part of the world. He was a loose thread, caught on a hook from another reality.

He looked at Elara, his form flickering. “The ledger,” he whispered, the words barely a disturbance in the air. “It seems… there’s one more entry.”

Then the compass glowed, not with the Heartstone’s power, but with a borrowed, desperate warmth from a pub three thousand miles and one thin Veil away. It pulled.

And Leo MacLeod, who had chosen to become a stitch, was yanked sideways—not into nothing, but into the space between the weave. A man turned ghost, turned story, turned thread, now snagged and reeled in by a sister who had never learned how to let go.

The last thing he saw was Elara’s hand reaching out for the empty air where he’d been, her fingers closing not around a man, but around a single, fallen leaf that shimmered with a faint, brass-like light.

In the renewed silence of the Glimmerwood, under the new-old stars, the Archivist began to weep. And her tears, falling on the dark, dormant Heartstone, were the first thing in her perfect, logical life that she made no attempt to catalogue.

# Chapter 12

## **CHAPTER 27**

The whisky was a peat-bog ghost, haunting the glass. Isla MacLeod held it up to the weak Glasgow light bleeding through the pub window, watching the amber liquid cling to the sides like a confession. It was ten in the morning. The pub, *The Hanged Man*, smelled of last night’s spilled lager and this morning’s despair, a perfume she knew more intimately now than her own skin.

“He’s late,” she said, to no one.

“He’s a concept, hen,” Morag replied from behind the bar, polishing a pint glass with a cloth that had seen more battles than the standard at Culloden. “Concepts are never late. They just are, or they aren’t.”

But Morag’s voice lacked its usual granite certainty. Her hands, usually performing their ritual with martial precision, fumbled. The aubergine dye in her hair had grown out an inch at the roots, showing steel-grey. For three days and three nights, Isla had sat here, or paced the tiny back office, or stood in the alley vibrating with a fury that felt like the only engine left in the world. She had poured every memory of her brother—his quiet patience, his hidden stubbornness, the way he’d fold a map with such care—into the cold, still air of the pub. She had demanded, not prayed. She had pulled, not begged. It was a violence of love, and it had left her hollowed out, a bell that had been rung too hard and now only held a silent, aching shape.

The brass disc of the improvised compass lay on the table before her, its needle inert, pointing to the pub’s gents’ toilet. A useless thing. A stupid, desperate thing.

She was about to throw the dregs of the whisky—her fourth, or maybe fifth; the count had lost meaning—into her mouth when the air in front of her *rippled*.

It was like heat haze off tarmac, but cold, and it smelled of ozone and damp earth and something sweetly alien, like petrichor after a storm on a distant world. The ripple bulged, distorted, and with a sound like a sigh woven from a thousand rustling leaves, it *tore*.

And a man fell out of nothingness onto the sticky tartan carpet of *The Hanged Man*.

He landed on his hands and knees, gasping. He was wearing a ruined tweed jacket, streaked with luminous moss and what looked like dried, silvery tears. In one white-knuckled fist, he clutched an ordinary museum-issue compass. In his eyes, when he raised his head, was the light of alien constellations.

“Leo?” The word was a scrape from Isla’s throat.

His gaze found her, blurred, then sharpened. The cosmic distance in it receded, replaced by a dazed, profound recognition. “Isla.” He looked at the whisky in her hand, the glass she held aloft like a frozen toast. A smile, fragile as a cobweb but real, touched his lips. “You’re… still here.”

Morag dropped the pint glass. It shattered on the well-trodden boards behind the bar. Neither sibling flinched.

Isla moved then, the chair screeching back. She didn’t run to him; she walked, each step deliberate, as if the floor might vanish again. She crouched before him, her eyes scanning his face—older, wearier, etched with stories she could not read. She didn’t hug him. Instead, she took his free hand, turned it over, and placed it, palm down, on the cold, solid, beer-sticky floor.

“Feel that,” she commanded, her voice raw. “That’s real. That’s *here*. You’re not a stitch in a tapestry. You’re my brother. And you’re late.”

Leo’s fingers curled against the tartan wool. A shudder ran through him. “I was woven in,” he whispered. “I was part of the… the repair. But you… you pulled a thread loose.”

“Aye,” Morag said, her voice thick. She leaned on the bar, looking at the shimmering, slowly-mending tear in the air behind Leo. It was the size of a door now, showing a glimpse of a twilight wood hung with impossible lights. “She did. With the sheer, pig-headed, unladylike force of her. Wouldnae listen to reason. Wouldnae let go.”

Isla finally looked at Morag, a flicker of the old defiance in her exhausted eyes. “You helped.”

“I provided the venue and the spiritual guidance,” Morag corrected, but she was watching Leo with the keen eyes of a priestess assessing a returned soul. “And the whisky. Seems you’ve brought some of the other place back with you, son. It’s clinging to your jacket.”

Leo looked down at the silvery stains. “That’s not from the other place,” he said softly. “That’s from the Archivist. She… she wept.”

The statement hung in the air, a perfect, strange jewel of information. Isla helped him to his feet. He was unsteady, a sailor back on land after a lifetime at sea. He looked at the compass in his hand, then at the brass disc on the table. The ordinary compass’s needle gave a gentle, decisive swing, pointing not north, but directly at the fading rift in the air.

“Oh,” he said, understanding dawning.

“Tell me,” Isla said, guiding him to a chair. “Tell me everything.”

And as the weak Glasgow morning strengthened outside, bleeding pale gold onto the dirty pavement, Leo MacLeod began to speak. He spoke of the Glimmerwood, of the Veil, of the Heartstone and its theft. He spoke of Elara, the Archivist of a world that had banished chaos, and in doing so, had begun to die. He spoke of his own small, catalogued life, and how he had offered it up as a thread to mend a universal tear.

Isla listened, her hand never leaving his arm. Morag listened, polishing a fresh glass without ever taking her eyes off him, her role shifted from cynical commentator to witness.

When he finished, the pub was silent. The rift was now just a faint, shimmering scar in the air, like the memory of a heatwave.

“So you’re not an archivist anymore,” Isla said finally.

“No.”

“And you’re not… human? Not quite?”

He flexed his hand, watching the ordinary light catch on his ordinary skin. “I’m a hybrid. A Keeper. The Veil is healed, but it’s… sensitive. It needs a guardian who understands both sides. Who is part of both sides. The needle,” he nodded to the compass, now steady in his palm, “points to the thin places. My job is to watch them. To tend them.”

“A man with one foot in a fairy tale and the other in the Gorbals,” Morag mused. “That’s no’ a job, hen. That’s a diagnosis.”

But she said it with a new respect. The old dynamics—the dismissive, worldly-wise woman, the meek, intellectual man—had been incinerated in the trans-dimensional crossing. What stood before her was someone who had been unmade and remade by a responsibility far greater than any university tenure or pub ledger.

“And her?” Isla asked, her tone carefully neutral. “This Archivist?”

Leo’s gaze grew distant again, but warmly so. “She held the world together with logic and rules. She believed feeling was a flaw in the system. And then… she chose to feel. She let the world break, and then she helped remake it, knowing it would be messier, less perfect. She wept for a loss she chose to allow.” He looked at Isla. “You’d like her. She’s as stubborn as you are.”

“I don’t like anyone,” Isla grumbled, but she squeezed his arm.

The rest of the day was a quiet, seismic shift. Leo slept for twelve hours in the pub’s back room, while Isla guarded the door and Morag kept the world at bay. When he woke, the mundane reality of his old life began to reassert its claim, but it no longer fit. He saw the museum not as a repository of dead things, but as a sleeping garden of potential thin places. He saw the city not as a grey grid, but as a living body with scars of old magic and new wonder.

A week later, the summons came. Not by post or phone, but by a flicker of the aurora borealis in the reflection of his kettle, forming an address and a time.

*

The storage room of the McEwan Museum was exactly as he had left it, and yet utterly transformed. The dust still danced in the slants of afternoon light, but now each mote seemed to carry a tiny, prismatic charge. The artifacts no longer slept. The Benin bronze head hummed a low, ancestral song. The shattered Grecian urn seemed to hold its breath, not in sorrow, but in anticipation. A healthy, gentle glow—not the sickly pulse of before, but a steady, golden light—emanated from the collection as a whole.

In the center of the room, where the world had torn, a permanent, stable patch of shimmering, aurora-like light hung in the air. It was a window, or perhaps a door, about the size of a full-length mirror. Through it, Leo could see the Glimmerwood in perpetual, gentle twilight. A familiar, silver-leafed sapling was growing just on the other side.

He was studying it, the ordinary compass in his hand pointing directly at its heart, when the air within the shimmering patch *curtsied*.

And Elara stepped through.

She was different. The severe, silver-touched bun was gone. Her hair fell in a loose, dark cascade over the shoulders of a simple grey tunic, crossed by a leather baldric holding not a ledger, but a living vine that sprouted tiny, starlit flowers. She was visible, solid, *present* in his world. The rules had changed.

“Leo,” she said. Her voice was the same—clipped, precise—but it held a new music underneath, like a stream over stones.

“Archivist.”

A faint smile. “That title… no longer fits. The Archive is open. The stories are being written again, in real time. I am a Warden. The first, it seems, to cross the fully-healed Veil in an official capacity.” She looked around the storage room, her keen eyes missing nothing. “It resonates here. Your world has… missed this.”

“It doesn’t know it yet,” Leo said. He felt no fear, no awkwardness with her. They had shared a cataclysm. They had shared grief. The old hierarchies were ash.

“It will.” She approached him. The gender dynamics of their first meeting—her the powerful, immortal administrator, him the bumbling, mortal supplicant—were gone. They stood as equals: a Warden of a rediscovered wonder, and a Keeper of the threshold. He was no longer a resource to be used; she was no longer an authority to be obeyed. They were partners in a new, delicate balance.

“The Veil is whole,” she confirmed, though he already knew it in his bones. “But whole does not mean impermeable. It means healthy. It can breathe. It needs a point of contact, a steward. You are that. The compass chose you. The love that pulled you back… ratified the choice.”

“Isla,” he said, the name a talisman.

“A force of nature,” Elara agreed, a hint of awe in her tone. “A chaotic, loving, stubborn variable. The old world would have labelled her a dangerous instability. The new one understands she is a necessary catalyst.” She looked directly at him. “You are the bridge, Leo MacLeod. Not a passive stitch, but a living ligament. You will curate the connection. You will decide what whispers through, and what must be kept in balance. It is a role of immense subtlety. Of feeling.”

He nodded, looking from the shimmering portal to the compass in his hand. The needle was still, content, pointing home. He thought of the meek man who had entered this room months ago, afraid of his own shadow, seeking only to catalogue and hide. That man was gone, unraveled and rewoven with threads of starlight and sisterly fury and an Archivist’s tears.

“I’m not an archivist anymore,” he said, echoing his words to Isla.

“No,” Elara said. “You are a Keeper. And I am here to tell you that you do not keep alone.”

From the portal, another figure emerged. Tall, with bark-like skin and eyes of molten green, carrying a staff of woven light. A Glimmerwood guardian. Then another, and another. Wardens and Watchers, male and female and neither, stepping into the human world with cautious wonder. They did not bow to Leo. They nodded, as colleagues. As co-stewards.

The storage room was no longer a closet for the dead. It was an embassy.

*

The resolution was not a loud thing. It was not a battle won with a sword. It was a quiet, pervasive change, like the turning of a season.

Leo kept his small flat, but he also kept the back room of *The Hanged Man*. It became his unofficial headquarters. Morag, it turned out, had always been a kind of folk-Warden, tending the thin place that was her pub without having the words for it. Now, with the aubergine back in her roots and a new glint in her eye, she became his lieutenant. She handled the “mundane weird”—the confused drunk who’d seen too much, the curious cat that had brought back a glowing feather—with a practicality that was itself a kind of magic.

Isla went back to her life, but differently. The fury that had sustained her was now a calm, fierce protectiveness. She was Leo’s anchor to the ordinary, to the human. She reminded him to eat, to sleep, to laugh. And sometimes, when a particularly tricky diplomatic issue arose with the Fae-like beings who occasionally wandered through the portal, it was Isla’s blunt, uncompromising Glaswegian pragmatism that solved it. The male Wardens from the Glimmerwood, used to ancient protocols, were often baffled by her. The female Wardens, especially Elara, watched her with open fascination and respect. A new dynamic was being written, one where human feminine strength—not ethereal or magical, but grounded, gritty, and real—was a power to be reckoned with.

Elara visited often. She and Leo would walk the Glasgow Green, discussing boundary fluctuations, the health of the shared biomes, the occasional misplaced magical creature. Their conversations were easy, a meeting of minds that had been forged in the same fire. Once, she asked him about love, about the human concept of it as a chaotic, disruptive force. He spoke of his parents, of Isla. He did not speak of romantic love; there was no need. What existed between them was deeper—a profound, mutual trust, a shared purpose that transcended the old scripts. She was no longer his superior, nor a distant, magical woman. She was Elara, who had learned to weep. He was Leo, who had learned to stand.

One evening, as autumn began to bite at the Glasgow air, Leo stood at the window of his flat. The city sprawled before him, a tapestry of electric light and ancient stone. In his hand, the compass was warm. He could feel the Veil, a living, breathing thing now, stretched taut and healthy across reality. He could feel the thin places: one in the museum, one in the pub, one deep in the Botanic Gardens, another out on the moors. His territory. His responsibility.

He was no longer the man who hid in the stacks. He was the man who walked between them. The Keeper of the Thresholds. The brother who came back. The thread that bound two worlds, not through force, but through understanding; not through dominance, but through care.

He smiled, a quiet, sure thing in the gathering dark. He had spent his life looking for a fixed point, a true north. He had found it not in a direction, but in a balance. Not in a single world, but in the sacred, shimmering space between.

Down in the street, the lamp flickered once, and in that flicker, for a fraction of a second, it burned with the gentle, gold-and-silver light of the Glimmerwood. Then it returned to ordinary orange.

Leo MacLeod, the Keeper, watched it. He did not reach for a ledger. He simply held the compass, felt its sure, quiet hum, and understood his new purpose was not to catalogue wonder, but to protect it. To live it.

And in the silent, steady glow of the artifacts in a museum storage room, and in the rustle of leaves in a wood beyond the world, and in the fierce, enduring grip of a sister’s hand, the story did not end. It simply changed key. It resonated.

**FINAL.**

# Chapter 13

## **CHAPTER 13**

The rain was not water, but a kind of liquid memory. It fell on Glasgow in a relentless, grey whisper, each drop carrying the echo of a thousand other rains, on stone, on steel, on skin. Leo MacLeod stood under the awning of a shuttered newsagent, watching it sheet across the empty expanse of Kelvingrove Park. The compass in his pocket was a silent, warm weight, a second heartbeat. He had taken to walking the city at dawn, tracing the perimeter of his quiet kingdom—the museum, the pub, the Botanic Gardens, the southern edge of the moors. A circuit of calm. A keeper’s rounds.

This morning, the calm was a veneer.

It was in the way the rain seemed to *avoid* a particular bench near the river, leaving it dry in a perfect, unsettling oval. It was in the scent on the air, beneath the petrichor and diesel: ozone and hot metal, the smell of a subway tunnel after a spark. A thin place was breathing nearby, and its breath was febrile.

He turned his collar up, not against the cold, but against the prickle of wrongness. He crossed the street, the wet asphalt gleaming like obsidian. The dry bench drew him. As he approached, the rain began to hit its slats, the dry patch shrinking as if exhaling a final, held breath. On the bench, left where a person’s thigh would have been, was a single item: a woman’s leather glove, dark brown, elegant, and impossibly, meticulously clean.

Leo did not touch it. He crouched, his knees protesting. The glove was calfskin, finely stitched, the kind Isla might have worn in her old life, before peat and ghosts and whisky. But it was not hers. This was older. The style was a decade out of date, yet it showed no wear. No scuff at the fingertips, no softening of the leather. It was a snapshot of an object, preserved. A concept, as Morag would say. He felt the Veil here, not as a healthy membrane, but as a scar—puckered, tender, holding the shape of something that had pressed through and then been withdrawn.

He took his own gloves from his pocket—thick, woolen things, practical—and only then picked it up. It was cool. Not the cool of the morning, but the deep, inert cool of a stone in a cellar. He turned it over. Inside, on the tag, was not a brand name, but a single word, handwritten in faded blue ink: *Aisling*.

A dream. A vision.

The hook in his mind was subtle, but undeniable. This was a marker. A signpost left by something that knew how to navigate the interstitial spaces, and knew, perhaps, that a new keeper walked them. It was not a threat. It was an introduction. The thought chilled him more than outright menace would have.

He placed the glove in a plastic bag from his pocket, sealed it, and slipped it into his satchel. The act felt absurdly normal, a curator preserving an exhibit. But the rituals of his old life were the armature for the new. He stood, his gaze sweeping the park. Nothing moved but the rain and the distant, hunched figure of a jogger. The thin place had settled, its fever broken for now. But the infection, he sensed, remained.

*

Isla’s flat smelled of lemon polish and gun oil. The two scents, domestic and deadly, had become the perfume of her redemption. She was at the small table, the components of Morag’s old Webley revolver laid out on a soft cloth like a surgeon’s instruments. Her hands moved with a methodical, reverent precision that was new. The frantic energy that had once driven her—from library to archive to pub to despair—had been refined into focus. She was cleaning the weapon not because it was dirty, but because the ritual grounded her. It was a fixed point.

Leo’s key turned in the lock. She didn’t look up. “You’re back early. The city’s thresholds behaving themselves?”

“One of them coughed up a mystery.” He shrugged off his damp coat, hanging it with care on the hook by the door. His movements were quieter now, more economical. The Leo who had entered her life had been a collection of sharp angles and startled motions. This one had a settled gravity. He placed the plastic bag on the table beside the gun’s barrel.

Isla put down her cleaning rod. She opened the bag, peered in, but did not remove the glove. “Calfskin. Good quality. Old.”

“It was dry in the rain. Then it wasn’t. The Veil around it felt… surgical.”

“*Aisling*,” she read the tag, her voice flat. “Portent or taunt?”

“An opening move.” Leo filled the kettle, his back to her. “It knows I’m there. Watching. It wanted to be seen leaving this.”

“It?” Isla prodded.

“A presence. Not a ghost. Ghosts are echoes, they’re messy. This was precise. Deliberate. Almost courteous.”

Isla snorted, a short, sharp sound. “Courtesy from beyond the Veil. That’ll be a first.” She leaned back, studying her brother. The lamplight caught the silver just beginning to thread at his temples, the new lines of concentration around his eyes. He was no longer just her little brother. He was a colleague. A counterpart. Their dynamic had shed its old, cumbersome skin. There was no hierarchy between them now, only a parity forged in the Glimmerwood and tempered in the silent watch over Glasgow. He was the Keeper of the Thresholds. She was the Warden of the Artifacts. Two sides of the same coin, struck in a realm beyond mortal minting.

“We need Finch,” she said finally.

Leo turned, leaning against the counter. “Finch is a retired academic who lives on single malt and regret. What can he tell us about polite gloves?”

“He wrote the book on interstitial realities. Literally. If something is moving between with this much… *etiquette*, it’s playing by a set of rules. Finch catalogues rules. He’s a taxonomist of the impossible.” She began reassembling the Webley, her fingers sure. “Besides, he owes me. My thesis made his last book possible. He said it was ‘the foundational text for a new paradigm of phenomenological border-studies.’ Pompous arse. But he meant it.”

Leo smiled, a faint thing. “You want to call in a scholarly debt.”

“I want to consult a resource.” The revolver clicked together in her hands, a sound of finality. “We’re not stumbling in the dark anymore, Leo. We have roles. We have tools. This,” she gestured to the bagged glove, “is a query. We should answer it with research, not just instinct.”

He nodded. The logic was sound. It was her kind of logic—direct, strategic, unburdened by the awe that still occasionally stole his breath. He was the feeler of the Veil, the listener at the threshold. She was the analyst, the archivist of anomalies. Their partnership worked because their instincts were different, but complementary. He would have watched the glove for nights, sensing its resonance. She would immediately seek its provenance.

“Write the letter,” he said. “Use the good paper. The pressed-bone stuff he likes.”

*

Professor Alistair Finch’s study was a controlled catastrophe of paper. Towers of journals leaned like Pisa; open books lay sprawled on every surface, their spines cracked, annotated with furious marginalia in three different colours of ink. The air was thick with the smell of dust, pipe tobacco gone cold, and the faint, sweet-sour tang of ageing sherry. He was a tall man, folded into a wingback chair that seemed to be consuming him, his cardigan a faded tapestry of moth-holes and old stains.

He held Isla’s cream paper letter between thumb and forefinger as if it were a rare specimen. “*Aisling*,” he murmured, his voice a dry rustle. “You understand the term’s weight, of course. Not a mere dream. A specific vision, often prophetic, granted by a woman of the *aes sídhe*. A summons, or a warning. That it is attached to an object… that is classical. Deeply classical.”

Isla sat perched on the edge of a hard chair, back straight. Leo stood by the mantelpiece, ostensibly examining a collection of corroded brass astrolabes, his senses tuned to the room’s metaphysical hum. It was quiet, just the low drone of academic entropy.

“Classical how?” Isla asked.

Finch’s eyes, magnified by thick spectacles, gleamed. “The Folk do not send emails, Dr. MacLeod. They leave tokens. A comb in a stream. A shoe on a path. A glove on a bench. They are… applications. Requests for audience. Or bait for the unwary.” He set the letter down. “The cleanliness is the key. In our world, entropy reigns. In theirs, stasis. An object that passes through and returns often bears the mark of that stasis—suspended decay. You say the Veil felt ‘surgical’. That implies a practitioner. Not a wild thing. A conscious entity.”

“A practitioner from over there?” Leo asked, turning from the mantel.

“Or from over here, who has learned to walk there,” Finch said, steepling his fingers. “Your own recent… integration… proves the possibility, Mr. MacLeod. The old tales are full of humans who learned the steps, the passwords. The witches, the cunning-men, the saints. They walked the paths not as conquerors, but as negotiators. The glove suggests a negotiator is at work. One with a feminine aspect, given the token.”

Isla’s jaw tightened. “Negotiating for what?”

“That,” Finch sighed, a sound of pages turning, “is the question that has consumed better minds than mine. Usually, it is for balance. A correction. Something has been taken, or given, and the scales are off. The Folk are accountants of a sort, but their ledger entries are lives, memories, the potential of a bloodline.” His gaze drifted to Leo, then back to Isla. “You two have been remarkably active. Stabilising thin places. Binding tears. You have altered the local metaphysical economy. Perhaps this is a statement of account.”

Leo felt a cold trickle down his spine that had nothing to do with the draft in the room. He thought of his rounds, the gentle pressure of his will on the weak spots in the Veil, the way he soothed them like bruises. He had thought he was healing. What if he was redistributing?

“How do we respond?” Isla’s voice was clipped, professional. She was already thinking three steps ahead, to action.

“You have the token. The next move is yours. But I would advise… circumspection. You are not dealing with a phantom. You are dealing with a bureaucracy. An ancient, capricious, and utterly literal-minded bureaucracy. If you seek an audience, you must offer a token in return. Something of personal significance, yet also symbolically open. And you must leave it at a thin place at the correct hour—twilight, neither day nor night. The in-between for the in-between.”

“And if we ignore it?” Leo asked.

Finch removed his spectacles, polishing them on his cardigan. “Then the negotiations may continue without you. Terms may be set on your behalf. I wouldn’t recommend it.” He looked at them both, his old eyes suddenly sharp and clear. “You have formed a dyad. A stable, balanced unit of power. That is rare. It makes you strong. It also makes you a target. For alliances, or for dismantling. Be careful what ledger you sign your names in.”

*

The thin place in the Botanic Gardens was not the grandest, but it was the most articulate. It lived in the old Kibble Palace, the Victorian glasshouse where humid air clung to the skin and the sound of dripping water was a constant, quiet percussion. It was in the shadow of a giant Australian tree fern, where the light fell in dappled, green-gold sheets that seemed to have weight. Here, the Veil was not a scar, but a whisper, a constant, soft exchange between the damp earth smell of this world and the crystalline, floral scent of the other.

At twilight, the glasshouse was closed to the public. Isla and Leo stood by the fern, the only sound the plink of water from a nearby rockery. In Isla’s hand was their token: not one object, but two. A single, well-worn page torn from one of Leo’s old library ledgers, on which he had drawn, in precise, measured lines, a map of the four stable thin places in Glasgow. And paperclipped to it, a single brass cartridge case from Morag’s Webley, fired long ago, cleaned until it shone.

“A map and a spent round,” Isla had said, assembling the offering. “Knowledge of the borders, and the capacity for violence, now discharged. A statement of what we are, and what we choose not to be.”

It was a good token. Honest.

Leo held the compass. Its needle, usually drifting in a slow, contented circle, was motionless, pointing directly at the heart of the fern. The Veil here was taut, expectant.

“Ready?” Isla whispered.

He nodded. She stepped forward and placed the small bundle on a flat stone at the fern’s base. They stepped back, into the gathering gloom under the glass.

For a long moment, nothing. The drip of water. The sigh of the heating system. Then, the air before the fern *shimmered*. Not a tear, not a flicker, but a deliberate, localized rippling, as if space itself were a curtain being drawn aside by a steady hand.

A woman stepped through.

She was tall, willowy, dressed in a suit of a style contemporary with the glove—tailored, elegant, in a deep charcoal grey. Her hair was the colour of old ash, swept into a severe chignon. Her face was ageless, not young, not old, carved from pale marble with a disturbing, perfect symmetry. She looked like a senior civil servant from a particularly austere ministry. Her eyes were the colour of a winter sky just before snow.

She did not look at them. She looked at the offering on the stone. She bent, a motion so fluid it seemed to lack joints, and picked it up. She studied the map, her expression unreadable. She held the spent cartridge to her nose, inhaled once, and gave a small, almost imperceptible nod. Then she placed both items into a slim leather portfolio she carried.

Finally, she turned her gaze upon them. It was not a malevolent look. It was an appraisal. The look a surveyor gives a parcel of land.

“Keeper,” she said, her voice a low, resonant contralto that held no echo, yet seemed to fill the glasshouse. Her eyes were on Leo. Then they shifted. “Warden.” To Isla. She knew the titles. The cold trickle down Leo’s spine became a stream.

“You left a token,” Isla said, her own voice steady, devoid of deference or fear. Stating a fact.

“A receipt was required,” the woman said. “For the imbalance.”

“What imbalance?” Leo asked.

“The equilibrium of neglect has been disrupted.” She spoke as if reading a regulation. “This city’s thresholds were in a state of managed decay. A sustainable entropy. Your interventions have introduced… stability. A new constant. This has created a pressure differential across the Veil. A debt.”

“We were healing tears,” Leo said, a heat in his voice he hadn’t intended. “Preventing incursions.”

“You were altering a settled system,” she corrected, politely. “We are the auditors for this sector. I am Aisling. You may consider this a compliance review.”

Isla took a half-step forward, her posture defensive. “You’re from the other side? The Glimmerwood?”

Aisling’s lips twitched, the ghost of a smile that held no warmth. “The Glimmerwood is a preserve. A parkland. We are the administration. We operate in the spaces between the spaces. Your actions, while locally logical, have regional consequences. A stabilized threshold here increases strain elsewhere. A redirected flow of potential.” She opened her portfolio, withdrew a sheet of paper that seemed to be made of faint, woven light. “You are hereby notified of a pending rectification. To rebalance the ledger, one of the four stabilized nodes must be voluntarily relinquished. Returned to its prior state of permeable decay.”

“No,” Leo said, the word out before he could think.

Aisling’s winter-eyes fixed on him. “It is not a request, Keeper. It is a notification. Failure to comply will result in an enforced rebalancing. The chosen node will be… cleared. Its anchors dissolved.” Her gaze flicked to Isla, then back to Leo. “The anchors are, invariably, people.”

The threat hung in the humid air, colder than ice. Isla’s hand drifted towards her coat pocket, where the weight of the Webley rested.

“You can’t just dictate terms,” Isla said, her voice a blade.

“We can. We have. For millennia. You are new to your roles. This is your orientation.” Aisling folded the paper of light away. “You have until the next full moon to decide which node to de-stabilize. If you choose none, we will choose for you. The museum. The pub. The gardens. The moor. One must fall.”

“And if we refuse altogether?” Leo asked, his hand closing around the compass. It was vibrating now, a high, anxious frequency.

“Then the dyad is declared insolvent. And both anchors will be liquidated to settle the debt.” She said it with the tone of one explaining a standard clause. “The offering is accepted. The consultation is concluded.”

She gave one more nod, a model of bureaucratic courtesy. Then she turned, took a step towards the fern, and simply… folded. Space wrapped around her like an origami trick, and she was gone. The air settled. The Veil relaxed with a soft, almost relieved sigh.

The dripping water sounded violently loud in the sudden silence.

Isla was breathing hard, her fists clenched. “An audit. We’re being audited by fucking fairy accountants.”

Leo stared at the empty stone. The warm certainty of his purpose had evaporated, replaced by a cold, sickening calculus. Every act of healing, of protection, had been a line in a ledger he couldn’t see. He had sought balance, and in doing so, had tipped a scale he never knew existed.

“They’re not fairy,” he said, his voice hollow. “They’re the system. We’re not keepers. We’re… tenants. And we just violated the lease.”

Isla turned to him, her eyes fierce. “No. We are not playing by their ledger. Finch said they’re literal. We’ll find a literal solution. We don’t give up a node. We find a way to rebalance without sacrifice.”

“How?” The word was a plea.

“We go back to Finch. We research. We find the original terms of this bloody metaphysical lease.” She grabbed his arm, her grip iron. “We are not losing the pub, Leo. We are not losing Morag. We are not losing the museum, or the gardens, or that damned moor. They are *ours*. Our responsibility. Our home.”

He looked at her, at the furious, protective light in her eyes. The Warden of the Artifacts. She was not talking about objects anymore. She was talking about people, places, the fragile, ordinary magic they had sworn to protect. Her certainty was a flame in the creeping dark of Aisling’s cold logic.

But as they left the glasshouse, the full moon a pale smudge behind the rain clouds, Leo felt the weight of the choice like a stone in his gut. The compass in his pocket was silent, its needle spinning slowly, uselessly. It could guide him to the thresholds, but it could not guide him through this.

He had learned to walk between worlds. Now he had to learn to fight the laws that governed them. And the first rule of the fight was the one that chilled him most: to save everything, they might have to choose what to lose.

Outside the Kibble Palace, under a streetlamp that flickered with a steady, ordinary orange glow, a single, perfect brown leaf lay on the wet path. It was dry. In the centre of it, pressed into the veins, was the clear, crisp imprint of a woman’s heeled shoe.

The negotiation was not over. The auditors were still watching. And the full moon was rising, a silent, ticking clock in the sky.

# Chapter 14

## **CHAPTER 14**

The rain was a fine, persistent mist, a dampener of spirits and a solvent for resolve. It turned the sandstone of the university to a weeping, liverish red, and made the cobbles slick with a phosphorescent sheen under the sodium streetlamps. Isla walked with a purpose that was more armour than intent, her boots striking the wet pavement with a martial rhythm. Leo kept pace beside her, a half-step behind, his silence a dense, heavy thing. The compass in his pocket was a dead weight, its needle twitching in a slow, lazy circle as if stirred by a tide they could no longer feel.

They were going back to Finch. It was the only move on a board that seemed to have no other pieces.

*The Hanged Man* was a bruise of warmth in the grey afternoon, its windows glowing like a sickroom lamp. Morag was behind the bar, not polishing, but staring at a bottle of Islay single malt as if it contained the answer to a question she hadn’t yet voiced. Her aubergine hair was a defiant shock against the gloom. She looked up as they entered, the bell above the door giving a tired jangle.

“Back so soon?” she said, her voice stripped of its usual piratical bravado. It was flat, a statement of fact. “The air’s different. Tastes of tin.”

“We need to see Finch,” Isla said, shrugging off her coat. The pub’s heat was a physical pressure after the cold outside. “Aisling gave us a ledger. A balance sheet. We’re in the red.”

Morag’s eyes, the colour of flint, moved from Isla to Leo and back. “Metaphorical red, or the kind that stains?”

“The kind that evicts,” Leo said, finding his voice. It was rough, unused. “They want a node. A place of power. To settle the account.”

A slow, deep breath expanded Morag’s chest. She reached for the Islay malt, poured three fingers into a clean glass, and drank it neat. She did not wince. “Which one?”

“They didn’t specify,” Isla said. “But the implication was… any of them. The pub. The museum. The glasshouse. The moor.”

“The moor,” Morag repeated, setting the glass down with a soft *click*. “That’s not a place, hen. That’s a lung. This city breathes through that peat and heather. You close off a lung, the body dies slow.” She leaned forward, her tattooed forearms braced on the bar. “Finch is in his warren. Hasn’t been out in two days. Took a delivery of books this morning that smelled of attics and mothballs. He’s digging. You’ll want to be quick. The moon’s getting fat.”

The door to the back rooms was ajar. The corridor beyond was darker than it should have been, the shadows pooling like ink at the base of the walls. The air carried a new scent beneath the familiar smells of damp and whisky: ozone, and the faint, acrid tang of burning hair.

Finch’s study was a catastrophe of focused intent. The great desk was invisible beneath a landslide of open volumes, unrolled scrolls, and loose sheets of paper covered in his frantic, spidery script. The man himself was perched on a stool, a magnifying glass in one hand, a nib pen in the other, its tip black with ink. He wore a dressing gown over his shirt and trousers, and his hair stood in wild, white tufts. He did not look up as they entered.

“The lease,” he muttered, to the vellum before him. “It’s not a lease. A lease implies a landlord. A superior authority.”

“Professor,” Isla said.

He flinched, the magnifying glass dropping from his hand to land softly on a pile of papers. His eyes, when he lifted them, were red-rimmed, blazing with an exhausted fire. “MacLeod. Kincaid. You’ve seen them. The auditors.”

“We have,” Leo said. “They’re… efficient.”

“Efficiency is their ontology,” Finch snapped, swivelling on his stool. “They are the manifestation of a system that abhors narrative imbalance. You introduced a story—a gendered, messy, *human* story—into a closed loop of symbolic exchange. You didn’t just cross a threshold. You redecorated it.” He gestured wildly at the chaos around him. “I have been searching for the original covenant. The terms of engagement between our… tenancy… and the underlying structure.”

“And?” Isla’s voice was a blade.

“And it is not written in any book I own,” Finch said, a note of despair creeping into his fervour. “It is written in the land. In the stone and the water and the root. It is precedent. Custom. A thousand handshake deals made in the mist by people who are now bones. The auditors don’t care for custom. They care for the ledger.”

Leo felt the stone in his gut grow colder. “So there’s no contract to break. No higher power to appeal to. Just them, and their numbers.”

“Precisely!” Finch cried, as if this was a breakthrough rather than a death sentence. “They *are* the higher power. Or its clerical staff. We are not dealing with capricious fairies. We are dealing with accountants for God.”

Isla stepped forward, placing her hands on the desk, leaning into the mess. “Then we don’t appeal. We negotiate. On our terms. You said they’re literal. So we give them literal balance. Not a node. Something else of equal… weight.”

Finch stared at her. The frantic energy seeped out of him, leaving a hollowed-out scholar. “Weight. Measure for measure. The oldest law.” He rubbed his eyes. “What do you propose to weigh against a place of power, MacLeod? What in this mortal city is its equal?”

She did not hesitate. “A story.”

The room went very still. The only sound was the faint hiss of the gas lamp.

“Explain,” Finch whispered.

“Aisling said we created an imbalance. A story of protection, of warding, that drew too much from the… the source. That our narrative had weight. So we give them a narrative back. One that settles the account.” Her eyes were fixed on some middle distance, seeing the shape of the idea as it formed. “Not just any story. A true one. A foundational one. The story of how this tenancy began. We give them the origin myth.”

Leo understood. It was a gambit of pure, terrifying instinct. “We don’t have it.”

“We find it,” Isla said, turning her gaze to Finch. “You said it’s in the land. We ask the land.”

Finch let out a sound that was half-laugh, half-sob. “Ask it? The land doesn’t speak, girl. It whispers. In riddles. In the pattern of frost on a window, in the way a river bends, in the name of a place that’s been forgotten.”

“Then we listen,” she said, implacable. “We have until the full moon. We have the nodes. Each one is a… a syllable. We piece the word together.”

It was madness. It was the only play. Leo felt the Warden in him stir, not the keeper of objects, but the listener at the threshold. This was a different kind of walking between. This was walking backwards, into a past that was not memory, but sediment.

Finch pushed himself off the stool, his dressing gown flapping. He moved to a shelf, pulled down a heavy, leather-bound folio that was not a book, but a case. He opened it on the desk. Inside were maps. Not printed maps, but hand-drawn, on parchment and hide and, in one case, what looked like a large, dried leaf. They were tracings of the city and its hinterlands, but not as any cartographer would recognise them. They showed lines of force, concentrations of what he had labelled *numinous potential*. The nodes were marked: *The Hanged Man* was a knot of intersecting lines. The museum a slow, swirling vortex. The Kibble Palace a delicate, crystalline lattice. The moor a vast, dark pool.

“The land’s memory is topological,” Finch said, his finger tracing a line that ran from the river to the cathedral. “It remembers where power pooled, where agreements were struck. These maps… they are echoes. But the original story, the signature on the first handshake…” His finger stopped at the centre of the moor. “If it is anywhere, it is there. The heart of the silence. The oldest wound.”

“Then that’s where we start,” Isla said.

“No,” Leo heard himself say. They both looked at him. “We don’t start at the heart. We start at the edges. We ask the… the witnesses.” He thought of the quiet sentience of the museum at night, the watchful stillness of the glasshouse plants. “The nodes aren’t just batteries. They’re records. They’ve been there. They’ve seen.”

A slow, grudging respect dawned on Finch’s face. “A circumambulation. A walking of the bounds. To gather the fragments before approaching the centre.” He nodded. “It is proper. It is respectful.”

“It’s also all we’ve got,” Leo said.

The plan was forged there, in the cluttered, ozone-scented study. They would walk the nodes, not as Wardens, but as supplicants. They would ask, and they would listen. Isla and Leo would take the inner city sites—the museum, the glasshouse. Finch, with Morag as his guide and anchor, would take the pub and begin the research into the moor’s specific lore. They would reconvene at *The Hanged Man* at moonrise.

As they prepared to leave, Finch caught Isla’s arm. His grip was surprisingly strong. “MacLeod. A warning. When you ask the land for a story, you are not reading a book. You are unburying a corpse. It may have things to say you do not wish to hear. Stories have teeth. This one… it will have a gender, too. The first stories always do. Be ready for whose voice it is, and whose it is not.”

The mist had hardened into a true rain by the time they reached the museum. It was closed to the public, a monolithic bulk of shadowed Victorian Gothic. Leo used his key at the staff entrance, the click of the lock absurdly loud in the dripping silence of the back alley. Inside, the darkness was absolute, a velvet pressure against the skin. Leo did not turn on the lights. He took the brass compass from his pocket. It was no longer spinning. Its needle pointed, with a steady, unwavering certainty, down the main corridor, towards the oldest wing.

They walked through the familiar halls, but the familiarity had been stripped away. The cases of artefacts were not displays; they were graves. The air was thick with the silence of watched sleep. The needle led them to the Early Peoples gallery, to a case that held a collection of Bronze Age jewellery: torcs and arm rings of twisted gold, found in a peat bog on the edge of the city.

Isla stood before the case. “How do we ask?”

“We don’t,” Leo murmured. “We just… stop. And be present.”

They stood side by side in the dark. Leo let his Warden sense unfold, not reaching out, but lowering a guard he usually kept high. He felt the museum’s dreaming consciousness first—a vast, slow hum of accumulated memory, of dust and careful labels and the ghost-impressions of a million curious glances. And beneath that, older, colder: the patient, mineral silence of the objects themselves.

The gold in the case did not speak. It sang. A low, thrumming note, a vibration in the marrow. It was not a song of beauty, but of weight. Of being taken from the dark earth, shaped by fire, worn against skin, and then returned to the dark, wet earth. A cycle of possession and sacrifice.

An image, clear and sharp as a shard of glass, pierced Leo’s mind: not of a person, but of an action. A woman’s hands, weathered and strong, winding a length of twisted gold around her upper arm. Not for adornment. For binding. A pact. She looked out across a landscape of mist and water, her face set in lines of grim necessity. Then she took the torc off, kissed it, and threw it into the black water of a lochan. An offering. Not to a god. To a *condition*. A price paid for a space held safe. *Here*, the memory whispered. *We may live here, if we give this. If we remember the cost.*

It was not the story. It was a footnote. A receipt.

Leo gasped, stumbling back a step. The connection broke. The museum’s everyday silence rushed back in, now feeling thin and fragile.

“Did you see?” Isla’s voice was hushed.

“A payment,” Leo said, his own voice strange to him. “For the right to be here. It was a woman.”

Isla’s jaw tightened. She gave a single, sharp nod. “Of course it was.”

The Kibble Palace was a cathedral of stolen humidity, its air a tropical breath in the Glasgow night. The great fronds of the ferns hung still. The orchids were lurid, waxen mouths in the semi-darkness. Here, the compass needle led them to the oldest tree in the collection, a giant fig, its aerial roots forming a wooden cage around its own trunk.

They stood within its grotto-like embrace. The feeling here was different from the museum’s deep-time silence. This was a vigilant, photosynthetic awareness. A memory of sunlight and rain, of being transported across oceans in dark holds, of taking root in alien soil.

This time, Isla stepped forward. She placed her palm flat against the rough, grey bark of the fig. She closed her eyes. Leo watched her, saw the tension in her shoulders, the slight tremor in her hand. She was not as practised at this listening; her strength was in action, in protection. This was a surrender.

The vision came to her in scent and texture. The taste of peat smoke and salt. The feel of coarse wool and cold, wet stone. A different woman—younger, her eyes wide with a terror that had been refined into resolve. She was planting a sapling, an oak, at a place where three streams met. Not for food, not for timber. For a witness. She spoke to it as she packed the earth around its roots, her words a soft, rhythmic stream. A story. She was telling the tree the story of why it was here, binding its life to a purpose. *Grow here*, the memory breathed. *Watch here. Remember why you were brought. Remember the pact.*

It was another fragment. A living record planted in the soil.

Isla pulled her hand back as if burned. She was breathing hard. “A witness,” she said. “They planted witnesses. To hold the terms.”

“So the land would remember, even if the people forgot,” Leo finished. The architecture of it was becoming horrifyingly clear. This was not a single contract. It was a network of obligations, a web of stories and sacrifices and living anchors, holding a fragile peace between the human world and the raw, structuring power beneath it. And they, in their well-intentioned blundering, had pulled on a single thread, threatening to unravel the whole.

They returned to *The Hanged Man* as the last of the twilight bled into a starless, moon-haunted navy. The pub was empty, save for Morag and Finch. A large, yellowed map of the moor was spread on the bar, held down at the corners by empty glasses. Finch looked up, his face pale.

“The moor is the ledger,” he said without preamble. “The entries are not written. They are buried. In the peat. The offerings, the witnesses, the… the defaults.”

Morag’s voice was a dry rustle. “Defaults?”

Finch’s finger tapped a point on the map, a place where the contour lines bunched like a frown. “When a payment was missed. When a story was forgotten. The land took its compensation. Not a place. A person. Always a woman. The ones who made the first pacts, who were the bridge. The system… balanced itself. By claiming its architects.”

The air left the room. Isla went very still. Leo understood the cold, surgical logic of it. A system of balance, built by women, maintained by their lineage, and ultimately enforced upon them. The ultimate patriarchal twist: a matriarchal covenant subsumed by a neuter, bureaucratic horror.

“That’s the choice, isn’t it?” Isla’s voice was dangerously quiet. “The ledger is out of balance. The system demands compensation. A node… or its equivalent weight. Which is a life. A woman’s life.”

“It is the precedent,” Finch whispered, his eyes full of a sickened awe. “The original terms are not about real estate. They’re about sovereignty. The right to be here was bought with gold, and with story, and with the ever-present possibility of a blood-debt. The auditors aren’t real estate agents. They’re bailiffs.”

Morag poured another whisky. Her hand did not shake. “So. We have our story. The first story. A story of women buying safety with their own potential sacrifice. A bloody, unequal bargain.” She looked at Isla. “That’s your counter-offer? You’re going to remind those clockwork ghouls of their own brutal origins?”

“No,” Isla said. The word cut through the gloom. She was looking at the map, at the dark pool of the moor. “I’m going to give them a new story. One that closes the old ledger for good.”

Leo felt a chill that had nothing to do with the draught under the door. “Isla. What are you planning?”

She turned to him. The furious, protective light was in her eyes again, but it was colder now, tempered into something steely and unbreakable. “We go to the heart. To where the first pact was made. And I am going to renegotiate.”

“You can’t! The precedent—”

“I am the Warden of the Artifacts,” she interrupted, her voice ringing off the tin ceiling. “But an artifact is just a story made solid. My job is to protect the stories. And this one is a poison. It’s a trap set millennia ago. I am not offering them a sacrifice. I am offering them an evolution. A new covenant.”

It was madness. It was hubris of a kind that made Leo’s blood run cold. To walk into the oldest wound, the very engine of the system, and declare the terms invalid. It wasn’t a negotiation. It was a revolution.

Finch stared at her as if seeing a new species. “They will not understand. Their logic is literal, historical. You are proposing metaphor. A future tense.”

“Then I will make them understand,” she said. She grabbed her coat. “We go to the moor. Now. Before the moon is fully risen.”

No one moved. The weight of her certainty was a gravitational force, pulling them into an orbit they had not chosen.

It was Morag who broke the spell. She came out from behind the bar, took her own heavy coat from a peg. “Well, if you’re going to tear down the architecture of reality, hen, you’ll need a pirate queen for moral support.” She looked at Finch and Leo. “Are you coming, or are you going to stand there gawping like you’ve seen the devil’s ledger?”

The drive to the edge of the moor was made in a silence so complete it felt like a third passenger in the car. The city fell away, its orange glow shrinking in the rear-view mirror, replaced by a darkness that was total, a suffocating blanket. They parked where the tarmac gave way to a rough track. The air was cold and clean, smelling of wet earth, decaying bracken, and something older: stone and stillness.

The full moon broke from behind a rack of cloud as they began to walk. It cast a sickly, bone-white light over the landscape, turning the heather into a sea of frozen, purple-black waves, and the peat hags into pools of absolute shadow. The compass in Leo’s hand was no longer a guide; it was a dowsing rod, pulling them forward, its needle pointing straight towards the heart of the darkness, to the place on Finch’s map where the contour lines had bunched.

Isla walked ahead, a small, determined figure against the vast, swallowing gloom. Leo followed, the stone of dread in his gut now a boulder. Finch stumbled along, muttering about topological memory and sacrificial geography. Morag brought up the rear, her breathing steady, a silent, grim anchor.

They reached the place as the moon reached its zenith. It was not a dramatic cleft or a stone circle. It was a depression, a bowl in the land perhaps fifty feet across, filled with dark, peaty water that reflected nothing—not the moon, not their faces. It was a blind eye. The air here was dead. No wind stirred. The sound of their own breathing seemed muffled, stolen away.

This was it. The heart of the silence. The oldest wound.

Isla stepped to the very edge of the black water. She did not look back.

“Aisling!” she called out, her voice not a shout, but a clear, carrying statement. “We have a counter-proposal.”

For a long moment, nothing happened. The moor held its breath.

Then, the water in the centre of the pool shivered. Not with a ripple, but with a geometric fracture, as if ice were forming in perfect, hexagonal plates. From this fracture, light emerged—not moonlight, but the same cold, white, sourceless light of Aisling’s office. It spread across the surface of the water, turning it into a flat, luminous plane.

And they stood upon it. Aisling, in her severe grey suit, and her two silent associates. They were not reflected in the water. They were *on* it, as if it were solid floor. The transition was seamless, literal, and utterly wrong.

“Warden MacLeod,” Aisling said. Her voice was the same, devoid of inflection. “You have returned before the deadline. Have you selected the node for decommissioning?”

“No,” Isla said. “I reject your ledger.”

Aisling blinked. It was a slow, mechanical action. “Rejection is not a valid input. The imbalance is quantifiable. A deficit exists. A deficit requires settlement.”

“I am offering a new settlement. A final settlement.” Isla took a deep breath. Leo saw her hands, clenched at her sides, were trembling. “The original covenant was flawed. It was based on a principle of recurring debt, a debt that always fell on the same line. I am here to pay that debt in full. Not with a place. Not with a life. With a story that ends the cycle.”

Aisling’s head tilted. “Clarify. What is the narrative unit you are proposing?”

“A renunciation,” Isla said, her voice growing stronger, filling the dead air. “I renounce the sacrificial logic of the first pact. On behalf of all who came after. The debt is not owed. The safety of this place is not purchased with blood or terror. It is earned. It is stewarded. By Wardens. By keepers. By people who choose to protect, not because they fear the bailiff, but because it is right.”

The auditors were silent. The two associates’ fingers twitched, as if taking invisible notes.

“Emotional appeal is non-procedural,” Aisling stated. “It carries no weight in the ledger. The historical precedent is established. The imbalance persists. Your… renunciation… is a null event.”

“Then make it an event!” Isla’s voice cracked across the water like a whip. “You are literal? Then take my literal act. I am the Warden. I stand in the place of the first makers. I void their contract. Here. Now. In the place it was made. That is an action. That has weight. Log it as a unilateral termination. A closing of the account.”

Leo’s heart hammered against his ribs. She was offering herself as the instrument of termination. Not as a sacrifice, but as a sovereign act. It was a breathtaking, terrifying legalism, using their own literal logic against them.

Aisling was still. The cold light around her seemed to pulse, very faintly. “Analysis: Proffered action constitutes a paradigm-level alteration. Precedent: None. Risk of systemic cascade: High. Proposal is… irregular.”

“But is it valid?” Isla pressed, taking a step forward onto the very lip of the water. “Can you process it? Or is your system only capable of taking, and not of being *released*?”

It was the right question. The only question. Leo saw it strike home. Aisling’s expression did not change, but the air around her grew sharper, colder. The two associates turned their heads in perfect unison to look at her, awaiting instruction.

“The system can process termination,” Aisling said, each word precise and heavy. “If the terminating agent possesses the requisite authority. And bears the full weight of the nullification.”

“How?” Leo burst out, unable to stay silent. “What does that mean?”

Aisling’s eyes slid to him. “It means the Warden must hold the entirety of the original pact—its history, its weight, its cost—within herself. And then, consciously, will it to be void. The psychic and metaphysical strain would be… considerable. It is not a transaction. It is an annihilation of a historical truth. Few minds could encompass it and remain intact.”

“I can,” Isla said, without hesitation.

“No,” Leo said, stepping forward. “Isla, you don’t know what that means!”

“I know exactly what it means,” she said, still looking at Aisling. “It means feeling every sacrifice. Every moment of terror. Every default. It means holding the fear of every woman who ever made a bargain with this dark. I am a scholar of liminal spaces, Leo. I have spent my life in the margins. I can hold it.”

She believed it. Leo saw the absolute, terrifying faith in her eyes. She believed she could swallow the poisoned story and neutralise it with her own will.

“Do you accept the terms, Warden?” Aisling asked. “Full immersion. Full integration. Followed by conscious dissolution. Success closes the ledger permanently. Failure…” She left it hanging. The silence was more eloquent than any threat.

Isla nodded. “I accept.”

“Isla!” Morag’s voice was a raw scrape. “Hen, don’t.”

But Isla was already stepping out onto the luminous water. It held her weight, a solid plane of light. She walked towards Aisling, until they stood face to face.

“Initiate,” Aisling said.

The light exploded.

It was not an outward blast. It was an inward rush. The cold, white luminescence from the water surged upwards, not as light, but as a torrent of *information*. Centuries compressed into seconds. The touch of cold gold on skin. The taste of peat-tainted water as a body was surrendered to the loch. The terror of the chosen, the resolve of the volunteer. The slow, grinding weight of a duty that was also a death sentence. The love for a place that demanded such a price. The story flooded into Isla, not as images or words, but as raw, experiential data—a tsunami of inherited female fear and fortitude.

She did not scream. She stiffened, her back arching, her eyes flying wide open. They were no longer her eyes. They were windows into a storm of history. Leo saw lifetimes flicker in their depths. He saw her knees buckle, but she did not fall. The light held her up, coursing through her, into her, filling her until she seemed to glow from within, a vessel on the point of shattering.

*She can’t hold it*, Leo thought, despair a cold knife in his throat. *No one could.*

But Isla’s mouth was moving. No sound came out, but he could see the word she was forming, again and again, against the pressure of a thousand silent screams.

*No.*

It was not a cry of pain. It was a statement. A verdict.

*No.*

To the fear. To the debt. To the endless, cyclical price.

*NO.*

The light within her reached a critical, blinding intensity. For one second, she was not Isla MacLeod, PhD candidate. She was a pillar of incandescent refusal, a human-shaped supernova of negation.

Then, with a sound like a vast, cosmic ledger slamming shut, the light vanished.

The darkness that returned was absolute, deeper than before. The luminous water was gone. The pool was just a pool of black, peaty water, reflecting the indifferent moon.

Isla collapsed.

Leo was moving before she hit the ground that was no longer light but soft, wet peat. He caught her, cradling her head. She was unconscious, her skin pale as wax, her breathing shallow and rapid. She was ice-cold.

The auditors were gone. There was no sign they had ever been there. No geometric fracture, no cold light. Just the moor, the moon, and the crushing silence.

Finch stumbled over, falling to his knees beside them. He felt for a pulse at Isla’s throat. “Alive,” he whispered. “But… empty. It’s all gone. The weight. The imbalance. I can’t feel it anymore. The nodes… they’re quiet. Just places.”

Morag stood over them, looking down at Isla’s still face. “What did she do, Leo?”

Leo looked up, his own eyes stinging. “She paid the debt. In full.”

He gathered Isla into his arms, her body frighteningly light. As he stood, his foot brushed against something in the heather. He looked down.

Lying on the damp ground was a single, perfect piece of twisted gold. An arm ring. It was clean, as if newly forged, with no trace of peat or age. It gleamed dully in the moonlight.

The system had not taken a sacrifice. It had given a receipt.

But as he turned, Isla a dead weight in his arms, Leo looked back at the black pool. On the far side, perfectly clear in the wet peat at the water’s edge, was a fresh imprint. The crisp, unmistakable mark of a woman’s heeled shoe.

The ledger was closed. The debt was paid.

But the auditors, it seemed, were still watching. The negotiation was over. The audit, however, had just begun.

## **CHAPTER 15**

The fire in the grate at *The Hanged Man* was a sullen, resentful thing. It consumed the peat bricks with a grudging, smoky flicker, casting more shadow than light. The heat it offered was a thin and miserly veil against the deeper cold that had taken root in Isla MacLeod’s bones.

She sat in the same corner booth as she had that first morning, the one by the window where the Glasgow light had bled through. Now, it was night, and the window showed only the reflection of the pub’s interior: Morag behind the bar, Finch hunched over a ledger, Leo staring into the amber depths of a whisky he hadn’t touched. Isla’s own reflection was a ghost-pale smudge against the black glass. She held a mug of sweet, strong tea in both hands, not for the warmth, but to feel the solidity of the ceramic, to test the simple truth of an object that did not dream or bleed or keep accounts.

She was empty. That was the only word for it. A vessel scoured clean.

On the scarred table between them lay the arm ring. It was not a dramatic centrepiece. It simply *was*, a closed loop of twisted gold that seemed to drink the firelight rather than reflect it. A receipt. The word tasted of ash and bureaucracy.

“It’s not a trophy,” Isla said. Her voice was a stranger’s—hoarse, used up. “It’s a marker. A tag.”

Leo finally looked up from his glass. The stinging in his eyes from the moor had hardened into something flinty. “For what?”

“For me.” She took a sip of tea. It was tasteless. “The debt was mine. The ledger was in my name. They closed the account, but they’ve filed me. For future reference.”

Morag leaned her hips against the bar, her arms crossed over her chest. The serene brutality of her pirate-queen demeanour was gone, replaced by a watchful, maternal ferocity. “You burned out the node. You screamed ‘no’ in the face of God’s own bookkeepers. You think they just walk away from an investment like that?”

Professor Finch closed his ledger with a soft thump. He looked older, the lines on his face not just marks of eccentricity but of a profound, scholarly shock. He had spent a lifetime studying the architecture of unseen bridges. He had never imagined watching someone burn one down from the inside. “The gendered cartography,” he murmured, not to them, but to the ghost of his own theories. “You didn’t just refuse their transaction, Isla. You refused the very map. The *terms* of the terrain. You became a terra incognita they could not plot. A woman-shaped blank space on their parchment.” He took off his glasses and polished them on his tweed waistcoat. “They cannot abide a blank space. Nature, and supernature, abhors a vacuum. They will seek to… re-categorise.”

Isla’s laugh was a short, dry crack. “Let them try.”

The force of the statement hung in the smoky air. It lacked the incandescent fury of her refusal on the moor. This was colder, quieter. A statement of fact from the emptiness. She had given everything that was asked, and then she had given the asking itself. There was nothing left for them to take. The realisation was not a victory; it was a desolate plateau.

Leo’s gaze shifted from her to the heel-print in his mind’s eye. Crisp. Deliberate. A woman’s shoe, left in the soft peat after the cosmic ledger had slammed shut. “The auditors are gone. The… *concept* of them, the light, the geometry. That’s finished. But the imprint was fresh. Someone else was there. Watching.”

“A witness,” Morag said. “Or a quality assurance officer. You don’t send a team of celestial accountants without a supervisor.”

“Or a rival firm,” Finch offered, his academic mind grasping for frameworks. “The interstitial realities are not a monopoly. Your refusal may have… voided a contract with one party, only to make you a person of interest to another. The old stories are full of such things. A soul, escaping a fairy debt, only to find a devil waiting at the crossroads with a newer, shinier contract.”

Isla’s fingers tightened on the mug. The emptiness within her echoed. It was not peace. It was the silence after the explosion, where every sound, every new presence, was a potential threat. “What do they want with an empty account?”

Leo reached across the table and picked up the arm ring. It was heavier than it looked. Cold. He did not hand it to Isla. He held it, feeling the weight of its intention. “Maybe they want to see what you’ll become,” he said, his voice low. “You’re not what you were. You’re not a node, or a conduit, or a debtor. You’re something they haven’t seen before. A woman who looked at the price and set it on fire.” He met her eyes. “That’s a power they’ll want to measure. To control. Or to eliminate.”

The fire popped, sending a shower of sparks against the grate. Isla looked from Leo’s weary, resolute face to Finch’s troubled academic gaze, to Morag’s protective scowl. They were her crew. Her derelict ship on a sea of rules she had broken. The debt was paid, but the cost was ongoing. It was the cost of being witnessed. Of being known.

“Then we don’t wait for them to come auditing,” Isla said. The ghost in the window seemed to solidify as she spoke. “We audit them back.”

Finch blinked. “My dear, that’s… that’s not how it works. The unseen bridges have protocols, not addresses. You can’t… file a complaint.”

“I’m not talking about a complaint.” Isla set her mug down. The click of ceramic on wood was definitive. “The heel print. It’s a clue. It’s a *material* clue, left in *our* world. That’s a breach in their professionalism. It’s sloppy. It’s emotional.” She leaned forward, a faint, cold light returning to her eyes—not the supernova of before, but the steady, penetrating beam of a lighthouse on a barren coast. “They’re watching? Good. Let’s give them a show. Let’s find out who left their signature in the mud. Let’s follow the supervisor home.”

Morag’s mouth quirked, the first hint of her old, brutal smile returning. “Now you’re talking my language, hen. You don’t wait for the taxman. You go through his books with a red pen and a righteous fury.”

Leo turned the arm ring over in his palm. A receipt. A tag. But also a token. A piece of their world, given in exchange. “This is gold. Old gold. Not just a concept. It has a weight, a history. It came from somewhere.” He looked at Finch. “You have colleagues. Archaeologists. Metallurgists. People who don’t ask why, they just ask *when* and *where*.”

Finch nodded slowly, the scholar re-engaging, the shock receding before the lure of a new, terrifying puzzle. “I know a woman. At the museum. She has… a pragmatic relationship with provenance. She asks very few questions for a very high price.”

“Then we start there,” Isla said. She did not reach for the arm ring. She let Leo keep it, this physical proof of her hollow victory. “We use their own clue. We turn their audit into our inquest.”

The plan, such as it was, formed in the smoky gloom. It was not a grand design, but a series of small, probing actions. Finch would approach his contact. Leo would use his own, less academic networks to ask about women—specific, particular kinds of women—who might be interested in lonely moors and closed accounts. Morag would mind the pub, the fixed point in their turning world, and listen. The Hanged Man was a crossroads; information bled in with the drunks and the desperate.

Isla’s role was the hardest. She had to learn to be empty. To move through the world as a blank page, feeling for the pressure of any pen trying to write upon her. She had to be the terra incognita, the silent alarm, the human-shaped silence that would resonate if anything tried to fill it.

Two days passed. The cold in her bones did not lessen, but she learned its contours. It was a clean cold. It sharpened her senses. Colours seemed more vivid, sounds more distinct, but they were all at a remove, as if she observed them through a thick, perfect pane of glass. She felt no fear. No anxiety. Only a vast, crystalline clarity. She was the void after the negation. And the void was watching back.

On the third morning, Finch returned. He found Isla in the back room of the pub, cataloguing Morag’s stock of esoteric spirits—whiskies from closed distilleries, liqueurs infused with rowan and hawthorn, things that were less beverages than liquid folklore.

He did not speak immediately. He stood in the doorway, his usual academic flutter stilled. He looked afraid.

“Elspeth McCready will see you,” he said finally. “She’s the senior curator of Iron Age and Early Historic Collections. She’s… formidable. And expensive. I had to promise her a viewing.”

“Of the ring?” Isla asked, her voice flat in the dusty air.

“No.” Finch swallowed. “Of you.”

The museum was a temple of ordered silence. Its halls were a cartography of human time, everything labelled, dated, securely cased. Isla walked through the exhibits of Pictish stones and Viking hoards, feeling like an uncatalogued anomaly. Her emptiness hummed faintly here, a dissonant note in the chorus of settled history.

Elspeth McCready’s office was not in the public galleries. It was a labyrinthine journey through staff corridors, past crates and trolleys, into the heart of the building where history was raw and uninterpreted. The office itself was a controlled chaos of artefacts, books, and the faint, dusty smell of old metal and acid-free paper.

McCready was a woman in her late fifties, with a severe grey bob and eyes the colour of flint. She did not rise from her desk, which was a landscape of paperwork and tiny, tagged objects. She looked at Finch with a nod of bare recognition, then her gaze settled on Isla. It was not a human look. It was an appraisal. A dating technique.

“Professor Finch speaks in abstractions,” McCready said. Her voice was clipped, Edinburgh. “Interstitial realities. Gendered cartographies. A load of metaphysical wool-gathering. I deal in *things*.” She pointed a finger at a small, corroded piece of bronze on her desk. “That is a thing. It was found in a bog. It has weight, composition, corrosion patterns. It tells a story of soil and time. Not of concepts.”

Isla said nothing. She let the woman’s gaze wash over her.

“But he also showed me a photograph,” McCready continued. “Of another thing. A gold arm ring. Twisted type. Late Iron Age, possibly early post-Roman. Except the one in the photograph has no patina. No wear. It looks… newly made. Or newly *un-made* from time.” She leaned forward slightly. “And he told me a story about a woman who paid a debt with a negation. Which is, again, a concept. A story. I am not interested in stories.”

“Then why are we here?” Isla asked. Her voice did not echo in the cluttered room. It was absorbed by it.

“Because of the shoe,” McCready said.

A beat of silence. Finch stiffened. They had told no one about the heel print.

McCready allowed a thin, humourless smile. “You have your sources, Professor. I have mine. A man walks into a pub in Oban, three days ago. He’s a hillwalker, a reliable sort. He says he was on a remote stretch of moor, day after the last full moon. Saw nothing unusual. But he did find, and I quote, ‘a right fancy lady’s shoe stuck in the bog, like Cinderella had a bloody awful night out.’ He thought it was rubbish, left it. But he mentioned it. In my line of work, you learn to listen for the odd detail that doesn’t belong.”

She opened a drawer and placed a clear plastic evidence bag on the desk. Inside was a single shoe. A pump, with a slender, sharp heel. It was made of a deep, emerald-green velvet, now stained and stiff with black peat. It was elegant, expensive, and utterly anachronistic on that ancient moor.

“This was retrieved yesterday,” McCready said. “By a person in my employ. The hillwalker was persuaded to be more specific about the location. It matches yours.”

Isla stared at the shoe. It was more disturbing than the arm ring. The ring was a symbol, a token. This was an intimate, personal object. It spoke of a body, a gait, a choice. A woman who stood in the wet dark and watched her refuse a cosmic debt.

“You can’t carbon-date velvet,” McCready said. “But you can trace a maker. This is not off-the-rack. This is bespoke. There are perhaps two dozen places in the world that could make this shoe. One of them is in this city.”

The void inside Isla shifted. Not with feeling, but with direction. A coordinate had been plotted. “Who?”

McCready’s flinty eyes held hers. “First, I see the ring. The real thing. Not a photograph.”

Isla glanced at Leo, who had been standing silently by the door. He hesitated, then reached into his inner pocket and drew out the twist of gold. He placed it on the desk beside the bagged shoe.

The effect was immediate. McCready’s professional detachment shattered. She did not gasp, but her breath caught. She pulled a pair of white cotton gloves from a box and put them on with ritual care. She did not pick the ring up immediately. She simply stared.

“My God,” she whispered. It was not a prayer. It was a curse of professional awe. “It’s… perfect. It’s not a reproduction. It’s not a fake. The twist pattern… it’s identical to the example from the Norrie’s Law hoard. But that’s in the National Museum. And this…” She finally lifted it, turning it in the light from her angle-poise lamp. “There’s no seam. No tool mark a modern eye can see. It’s as if it was *willed* into this form. The gold is pure. Too pure. Ancient gold has impurities. This is… theoretical gold.”

She looked up at Isla, her earlier disdain gone, replaced by a hungry, desperate curiosity. “Where did it come from?”

“They gave it to me,” Isla said. “A receipt.”

“They?”

“The ones the woman in the green shoes works for.”

McCready placed the ring down as if it were radioactive. She looked from it, to the shoe, to Isla’s empty face. The pieces, the tangible, physical pieces, were telling a story she could no longer dismiss. A story that broke her beloved rules of soil and time.

“The cobbler,” she said, her voice hushed. “His name is Alasdair Byrne. He has a workshop in the Merchant City. He makes shoes for theatre, for film, for… certain private clients with unusual tastes. He is a craftsman who believes his work is a kind of summoning. That the right shoe can help a person walk into another story.” She pushed a slip of paper across the desk. An address. “He will not speak to you. He is notoriously private. But he will speak to the ring. And to the woman who carries it.”

Isla took the paper. The address was in her hand. A point on the map. A thread pulled from the velvet.

“What do you want in return?” Leo asked, his voice gravelly with distrust.

McCready’s gaze was still locked on the arm ring. “I want to study it. For one night. Here, in my lab. I want to take measurements, photographs, spectrographic analyses. I want to know what a receipt from God looks like under a microscope.”

Isla nodded. It was a fair trade. A night of the ring’s time, for a name. “Done.”

They left the ring in that room of ordered history, a perfect, impossible anomaly among the broken shards of the past. As they walked back through the silent halls, Isla felt the first tremor in her emptiness. Not a feeling, but a pressure. A sense of being *followed* not by a person, but by an attention.

The heel-print was no longer just a clue. It was a challenge. A green velvet gauntlet thrown down in the peat.

Outside, the Glasgow afternoon was a dull, metallic grey. Leo lit a cigarette, the smoke whipped away by a cold wind. “Byrne,” he said. “A cobbler who thinks he’s a sorcerer. Of course.”

“He’s a link,” Isla said, folding the address into her pocket. “A human link. They used a human craftsman. That’s a vulnerability. It means they need our world, too. Its materials. Its skills. They can’t just concept everything into being.”

Finch huddled into his coat, looking back at the museum’s imposing façade. “McCready will learn nothing definitive from that ring. It will defy every analysis. It will break her machines with its perfection. It will haunt her for the rest of her career.”

“Good,” Isla said. She began to walk, her steps firm on the pavement. The void within her had a target now. A direction. The audit was turning. They were no longer just waiting to be assessed. They were following the evidence, from the supervisor’s signature in the mud, to the hand that made her shoe.

But as they turned the corner, Isla stopped. In the window of a closed charity shop, amid a jumble of old kettles and faded paperbacks, was a mannequin. It was headless, limbless, just a torso on a stand. It was wearing a jacket of a deep, emerald-green velvet.

It was just a coincidence. A trick of the light, of a mind now tuned to see patterns. Isla knew this. The rational part of her, the PhD candidate, catalogued it as such.

Yet, as she stood there on the busy street, the cold in her bones seemed to sharpen, focusing to a single, needle point between her shoulder blades.

The ledger was closed. The debt was paid.

But the woman in the green shoes was not just watching.

She was waiting. And she had exquisite taste.

# Chapter 16

## **CHAPTER 16**

The emerald velvet in the charity shop window was a vulgar echo. A cheap, moth-nipped imitation of the supervisor’s sumptuous green, but its presence was a punctuation mark in the grey sentence of the street. Isla stared at it, the cold between her shoulder blades a precise, academic pain. A hypothesis was forming, not in words, but in a visceral understanding of aesthetic language. The supervisor did not merely wear green. She curated it. She seeded it into the periphery as a signature, a taunt written in texture and hue.

“Isla?” Leo’s voice was a scrape of matchstick on sandpaper. He followed her gaze to the mannequin, his detective’s mind seeing a discarded prop, her academic’s mind seeing a footnote.

“It’s nothing,” she said, turning away. The lie was automatic, a membrane between her internal audit and the external world. She could not yet articulate the theory: that the supervisor’s power was not just bureaucratic, but artistic. That her cruelty had a palette.

Finch was already hailing a taxi, a frail arm raised against the Glasgow drizzle that had begun to bleed from the metallic sky. “Byrne’s address is across the river. Govan. A place where things are built, and things are broken.”

The taxi was a capsule of stale breath and synthetic pine. Isla sat with the address, a slip of paper now damp from her grip, feeling its ordinariness. 42b Keldon Lane. A human coordinate. Leo smoked out the window, the drizzle swallowing his exhales. Finch hummed a tuneless fragment of something old, his eyes closed, retreating into the cathedral of his own mind.

Govan unfolded outside the window, a landscape of muscular memory. The ghosts of shipyards loomed in vast, vacant lots, their skeletal gantries scratching at the bellies of low clouds. Here, the city’s pragmatism was laid bare—the making of tangible things, of hulls and engines, a philosophy of rivets and sweat. It felt like the antithesis of the supervisor’s realm of concepts and ledgers. And yet, a cobbler had bridged the gap. He had worked leather that walked between worlds.

Keldon Lane was a narrow street of two-storey workshops, their brickwork stained a perpetual industrial black. 42b was at the end, a unit separate from the others, its windows whitewashed from the inside. No sign announced a business. The only clue was a faint, acrid scent on the damp air—not just glue and dye, but something sharper, mineral, like ozone after a lightning strike.

Leo stubbed his cigarette on the wet pavement. “No bell. Of course.” He rapped his knuckles against the heavy steel door. The sound was swallowed, producing no echo.

They waited in the drizzle. Isla’s emptiness was a silent chamber, and into it poured the ambient pressure of the place. It was not the watchful attention of the museum, but a dense, focused silence, as if the air inside was too occupied to spare any for the outside world.

The door opened inward a crack, wide enough to reveal a single eye, the colour of old sherry, and a slice of a face webbed with deep, leathery lines.

“We’re closed,” a voice said, dry as dust.

“Mr. Byrne?” Isla stepped forward, placing herself in the narrow frame of his vision. “We’re not customers. We need to talk about a commission. A pair of shoes. Green kid leather. With a specific heel.”

The eye blinked, once, slow as a lizard. “Don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“The leather wasn’t from here,” Isla pressed, her voice low, a conspirator’s murmur. “It was brought to you. The design was… provided. The client was a woman. Unforgettable.”

A long pause. The drizzle pattered on Isla’s shoulders. Then, the door swung open fully, releasing a gust of that interior air—ozone, cedarwood, and the profound, soul-deep smell of worked hide.

“You’d better come in,” Seamus Byrne said. “Before the rain learns your business.”

He was a small man, compact as a root, dressed in a leather apron so old it had moulded to the shape of his body. His workshop was a cavern of ordered obsession. Lasts of every size hung from the ceiling like grotesque fruit. Tools were laid on benches with surgical precision—skiving knives, awls, lasting pincers. But along the far wall, on a separate bench of dark, oiled wood, lay tools that were different. Their handles were of a bone-pale wood, and their metal parts gleamed with a cold, blue-silver light that owed nothing to the single bare bulb overhead. On a shelf above them sat small, cork-stoppered jars. One held what looked like granules of solidified shadow. Another, a swirling, mother-of-pearl mist that moved with a life of its own.

Byrne did not offer seats. He stood before his sacred bench, a priest at his altar. “You mentioned her. So you’ve seen. You’ve been… assessed.”

“We have,” Finch said, his academic curiosity overriding caution. He peered at the jars. “Fascinating. Phasic resins? Condensed perceptual matter?”

Byrne ignored him, his sherry-coloured eyes fixed on Isla. “You carry the quiet about you. The hollow place. She leaves that.”

“You made her shoes,” Isla stated.

“I made *the vessels for her feet*,” Byrne corrected, his tone that of a theologian parsing dogma. “I did not *make her shoes*. The distinction is the contract. The leather was presented. The design was inscribed on a vellum that sang when you touched it. My role was application. Craft. The translation of concept into substance.” He walked to a small, heavy safe nestled beneath the bench. He worked the combination, not with his fingers, but with a series of precise, whispered taps from a small brass hammer. The door clicked open.

From within, he withdrew a ledger. Not black, like the supervisor’s, but bound in a mottled, tawny hide. He placed it on the bench and opened it to a page near the end. Isla saw a sketch, exquisite in its detail, of her own green shoe. Next to it, in a cramped, meticulous hand, were notes. *Client: The Assessor. Material: Kid, harvested from the grief-goats of the Silent Pastures. Dye: Verdure from the heart of a forgotten midsummer. Heel: To be shaped from a fragment of the Threshold Stone (provided). Payment: One (1) memory of my father’s voice, circa 1963. Delivered.*

“She pays in memories,” Isla breathed.

“She pays in *truths*,” Byrne said, a flicker of anguish in his deep-lined face. “The only currency that holds its value across the bridges. I asked for his voice. I got it. For three minutes, in this very room, I heard him call me ‘son’. Then it was gone. Spent. A coin in her infinite pocket.” He looked at Isla, his gaze probing her hollow centre. “What did she take from you?”

Isla said nothing. Leo answered for her, his voice a gravelly shield. “None of your damn business. You took a commission from a thing that audits human lives. You made the tools she uses to walk into our world.”

“I am a bridge-maker!” Byrne snapped, a flash of pride in his watery eyes. “The Interstitial Realities are not *other*. They are *between*. They require points of contact. Anchors. A concept must have a form to exert force. A law must have a ledger to be recorded. A supervisor… must have shoes to walk the floors of her domain and yours. I provide the points of contact.” He calmed, running a reverent hand over the sketch. “She is the most exacting client I have ever had. Her specifications are… sublime.”

Isla understood then. Byrne was not a collaborator out of malice, but out of a craftsman’s rapture. The supervisor had seduced him with the purity of her demands, with the opportunity to work with materials that sang of other worlds. He was in love with the making, blind to the purpose.

“Where does she go?” Isla asked. “When she’s not assessing. Where does she… exist?”

Byrne closed the ledger softly. “She has a place. A gallery. She calls it her *Salon of Finalities*. A space between spaces where she… curates the outcomes of her audits. The particularly poignant closures. The elegantly balanced debts.” He looked at them, and for the first time, a sliver of pity entered his expression. “You wish to find her. To plead? To negotiate?”

“To audit the auditor,” Leo said.

Byrne let out a short, dry laugh, like stones rattling in a tin. “You are moths seeking the architect of the candle flame. You cannot go to her Salon. It is not a location. It is a conclusion.”

“But you have a point of contact,” Isla said, her eyes going to the bench of strange tools. “You made her anchor. There must be a way to trace the line back. To follow the thread from the shoe to the foot.”

The cobbler was silent for a long moment, his gaze travelling from Isla’s determined face to Finch’s rapt one to Leo’s hardened scowl. He was weighing, Isla realised, not their chances, but the aesthetic merit of their desperation. Would it make a worthy exhibit in his own mind?

“There is a tool,” he said finally, his voice dropping to a whisper. “A needle, forged from the same fragment of Threshold Stone as her heels. I used it to stitch the soles. It carries a… sympathetic resonance. A hunger for its own kind.” He moved to the far end of the sacred bench and unlocked a slender drawer. From it, he lifted a long needle. It was the same blue-silver as the other tools, but darker, denser. It seemed to drink the light around it. “If you had a map of the in-between, this needle, laid upon it, would tremble in the direction of its source stone. It would point the way.”

“And where would one find such a map?” Finch asked, breathless.

Byrne’s lips thinned. “You have a metaphysician. He knows of the *Carta Incognita*. The map that is not a map.”

Finch went very still. “The Carta is a theoretical construct. A folio of pure potential. It’s never been seen.”

“It resides,” Byrne said, “in the Special Collections of the University Library. Locked in the Black Cabinet. A gift from a certain 18th-century nobleman who dabbled in more than whisky and wives.” He looked at Finch. “You are emeritus. You have the access. But the Cabinet… it requires a key of a particular nature. It reads intent.”

Isla took the needle from Byrne’s offered hand. It was colder than ice, a cold that seeped into her bones and made the hollow within her ache in sympathy. It felt alive, and hungry. “Why help us?”

Byrne looked at the safe where his ledger lay. “I have heard my father’s voice. It was a perfect payment. But perfection… it is a sterile country. I find I miss the noise. The mess. The uneven stitches.” He met her eyes. “And I am curious. I have made the shoes for the end of stories. I should like to see what happens when a story refuses to end.”

***

The rain had hardened into a persistent, needling downpour by the time they returned to the university. The Gothic spires of the main building speared the gloomy twilight, a fortress of known things. Inside, the air was warm and still, thick with the smell of old paper and dust.

Finch led them through the grand hall, past the marble stare of long-dead principals, to a discreet oak door marked *Special Collections – By Appointment Only*. His emeritus key card bypassed the electronic lock with a soft beep.

The room beyond was a twilight space, illuminated by pools of light from green-shaded lamps on long reading tables. Rows of dark-stained bookshelves receded into shadow, holding countless volumes sheathed in protective grey boxes. The air hummed with silence, the dense, absorbed quiet of secrets kept too long.

At the far end of the room stood the Black Cabinet.

It was an imposing piece, eight feet tall, of ebony so deep it seemed to be a slice of midnight given form. Its surface was inlaid with intricate marquetry of mother-of-pearl and silver, depicting constellations that were not of any earthly sky—swirling, non-Euclidean patterns that hurt the eye to follow. There was no visible keyhole.

“The Carta Incognita,” Finch murmured, approaching it with a scholar’s reverence. “Not a map of places, but of *possibilities*. Of the latent pathways that exist between states of being. It is the sub-basement of reality’s architecture.” He reached a trembling hand towards the cabinet’s central seam.

Before he could touch it, the mother-of-pearl constellations shimmered. A soft, silvery light traced the patterns, and a voice, androgynous and dry as parchment, filled the space around them, not through the air, but directly in the mind. *“Intent is key. Declare your purpose.”*

Finch flinched. Leo’s hand went instinctively to his coat, where no weapon resided. Isla stepped forward, the cold needle a secret in her fist.

“We seek the Carta,” Finch said, his voice unsteady.

*“Purpose is not acquisition. Purpose is application. Declare the use.”*

Isla spoke into the mental silence. “We seek a path. To a place between places. A Salon of Finalities.”

The cabinet’s light pulsed, a slow, rhythmic beat like a distant heart. *“The Carta does not chart destinations. It charts transitions. To find an interstitial gallery, you must name the transition you wish to make.”*

Isla thought of the green shoes, of the ledger, of the void inside her. “From debt to defiance. From audited to auditor.”

The silvery light flared, brilliant and cold. The central seam of the cabinet split soundlessly, the two doors swinging inward.

Inside, on a pedestal of clear crystal, lay the Carta Incognita.

It was not a scroll, nor a book. It was a folio of what appeared to be solidified light, or perhaps captured shadow, a material that shifted and swam as they looked at it. Within its depth, faint lines and symbols glimmered, constantly rearranging themselves—a living, reactive diagram of metaphysical potential.

“Extraordinary,” Finch whispered.

“Now the needle,” Isla said.

She approached, the Threshold needle held out before her. As she drew near to the Carta, the needle began to vibrate in her hand, a faint, high-frequency tremor that travelled up her arm. She held it over the surface of the shifting folio.

The reaction was immediate. The swirling lines on the Carta stilled, then rushed towards the point above the needle like iron filings to a magnet. They coalesced, solidified, drawing themselves into a stark, two-dimensional diagram. It showed a series of concentric circles, like a target, or the growth rings of an impossible tree. At the very centre was a small, pulsing dot of emerald green. Radiating out from it were three faint, dotted lines, like possible paths. One line was short, ending in a symbol that looked like a closed eye. Another spiralled out into a chaotic scribble before fading. The third, however, traced a slow, deliberate arc to the outer edge of the diagram, where it terminated at a symbol that made Finch gasp: a simple, stylised heel-print.

“It’s a protocol,” Finch breathed, leaning close. “Not a map of *where*, but of *how*. The paths represent different methodologies of transition. The closed eye… that is surrender. Acceptance of the finality. The chaotic path is madness, dissolution in the between-spaces. But this…” He pointed to the path leading to the heel-print. “This is the path of *the craft*. The path of the anchor. It uses the sympathetic link. It says that to reach her Salon, you must not travel through space, but through the medium of the artifact itself. You must… follow the making.”

Leo frowned. “What does that mean? Stitch ourselves a pair of shoes?”

“It means,” Isla said, her eyes fixed on the green dot at the centre, “we don’t go to the Salon. We get the Salon to notice us. Through the craft. Through a new point of contact.” She looked at the needle in her hand, then at the Carta’s precise, unforgiving diagram. “We have to make something. Not for her. But *of* her. And invite her to come and see.”

Finch paled. “Create an artifact tied to her essence? That is an act of profound aggression in her language. A forging of a bridge on our terms. It would be an audit of *her*.”

“Yes,” Isla said, the word final as a closing door.

The cabinet’s voice echoed in their minds once more, fainter now. *“The transition is defined. The path is perilous. The Carta warns: to craft a mirror for a supervisor is to risk becoming the reflection. The materials required are not of this world.”*

“We have a cobbler,” Leo said, his voice grim. “And we have a starting point.” He nodded at the needle. “We have a piece of her world.”

Isla carefully lifted the Carta from its pedestal. It was weightless, yet it felt heavier than stone in her hands, a condensed potential that made the air crackle. The diagram remained, frozen on its surface. A recipe for a confrontation.

As they turned to leave, the Black Cabinet doors swung shut with a soft, definitive *thud*. The silvery light in its inlay died, leaving it once more a slab of dormant night.

Back in the humid silence of the Special Collections room, with the living map in her hands and the hungry needle in her pocket, Isla felt the void within her shift. It was no longer just an emptiness. It was a mould. A negative space waiting to be filled not with what was taken, but with what she would now deliberately, ruthlessly create.

The supervisor collected finalities. She curated outcomes.

Isla MacLeod would offer her a new exhibit: the unfinished thing. The defiant draft. A shoe that did not fit, thrown at the head of the goddess of closure.

They moved through the library’s gloom, a trio of conspirators against conclusion. But as they passed a long, polished table, Isla saw it. Reflected in the dark, varnished wood, for the briefest fraction of a second, was not her own face, nor the bookshelves behind her.

It was a flash of emerald green, standing perfectly still, three paces behind Leo.

Isla froze. She did not turn. She held the reflection in the corner of her eye, her blood turning to ice water. The figure did not move. It simply watched, a splash of impossible colour in the monochrome reflection.

Leo, ahead of her, stopped. “Isla?”

She forced her eyes forward, breaking the connection. When she glanced back at the table’s surface, it showed only wood grain and shadow.

“It’s nothing,” she said again, the lie thicker now, a pill on her tongue.

But the hook was set. The audit was not a closed ledger. It was an open dialogue. They were crafting their challenge, and she, the woman in the green shoes, was already reading the draft.

The Salon of Finalities had just extended a new invitation. And the RSVP was written in the cold, hungry point of a needle, and the terrifying weight of a map that led not to a place, but to a precipice of their own making.

# Chapter 17

## **CHAPTER 17**

The map was a living, breathing accusation. It lay on the scarred oak table in the back room of *The Hanged Man*, its vellum surface faintly misting with each of Isla’s exhales. The ink—a concoction of oak gall, ground lodestone, and something Leo had called ‘moon-ash’—moved. Not much. A slow, capillary creep along the lines of force that underlay the city, a subcutaneous pulse. It was a map of Glasgow’s unseen ligaments, and in its centre, a void. A negative space shaped like the supervisor’s Salon of Finalities, a cartographic silence that swallowed the ink that ventured near its edges.

Morag leaned over it, her aubergine hair a violent splash against the nicotine-stained ceiling. She held a butcher’s cleaver, using the flat side to crush juniper berries into a mortar. The rhythmic *thunk-crack* was the room’s only steady heartbeat.

“So it’s a trap,” Morag stated, not asking. “You’re baiting a mousetrap with a ghost of a cheese that never was.”

“We’re offering an alternative narrative,” Leo corrected, his voice tight. He was dismantling a complex brass astrolabe he’d ‘liberated’ from the University’s archaeology store, his fingers precise and furious. “A story with the ending ripped out. A shoe that doesn’t fit.”

“Ach, spare me the poetry, son. It’s a trap. She’s the cat, you’re the mice with a wee, shiny bell you think is a weapon.” Morag swept the crushed berries into a small copper bowl. “And our Isla here saw the cat’s reflection, licking its paws, while you were drawing your wee battle plans.”

Isla said nothing. She was holding the supervisor’s needle. It lay across her palms, a sliver of distilled conclusion, colder than the Glasgow stone beneath the floorboards. The memory of the emerald green in the library’s reflection was a splinter behind her eye. It hadn’t been fear, precisely. It had been a kind of professional appraisal. The supervisor wasn’t angry. She was *curious*. A chef watching a sous-chef attempt a new, reckless recipe.

“She wants to see what we’ll build,” Isla said, her voice low. “The audit isn’t an inspection. It’s a… sourcing trip. We’re foraging for our own destruction, and she’s noting down the location of the best mushrooms.”

Leo looked up, his glasses catching the dull gleam of the single bare bulb. “Then we give her a poison one.”

“With what antidote?” Morag shot back. “You’ve got the poison needle, aye. You’ve got the map to the place you shouldn’t go. What’s the third thing? Every good story needs three. The weapon, the way, and the wager. What’s your wager, hen?”

Isla’s hand closed around the needle. The point was a perfect, hungry zero. It promised an end to all questions. “Myself,” she said.

The room went still. Even the creeping ink on the map seemed to pause.

“Explain,” Morag commanded, setting down her cleaver.

“The supervisor collects finalities. She curates outcomes.” Isla met the old woman’s gaze. “My thesis… it was a draft. An unfinished thing. She took it and finished it. Made it *hers*. Made it *done*.” She placed the needle on the map, its point hovering over the void of the Salon. “So I give her another draft. Me. The unfinished Isla MacLeod. The one with the void inside, the one who is all potential and no resolution. I walk into her Salon not with a finished story, but with a blank page. And I dare her to try and write an ending on it.”

Leo went pale. “That’s not a wager, that’s a suicide note. She’ll just… file you. Put you in a drawer labelled ‘Resolved: Pathetic’.”

“Will she?” Isla’s smile was thin, a crack in ice. “She’s a perfectionist. She needs the right ending, the elegant solution. A messy, defiant, ongoing draft? A woman who is a living ‘to be continued…’? That’s her antithesis. It’s the one thing she can’t curate without destroying the essential quality. It’s the shoe that doesn’t fit. Throw it hard enough, it might break her nose.”

Morag stared at her for a long moment. Then a slow, jagged grin split her face. “Ach, you’ve gone feral, hen. Proper feral. It’s a terrible plan. It’s all posture and no knickers.” She picked up the copper bowl and upended it over the map. The crushed juniper scattered across the vellum like coarse, fragrant dust. “But it’s the only kind of plan that has a heartbeat. So. We need to make you a proper draft. Unfinishable.”

She lumbered to a locked cabinet behind the bar, returning with a bottle containing a liquid the colour of a week-old bruise. “This,” she said, “is *Beatha na h-Òige*.”

“The Water of Life?” Leo frowned. “It looks like death.”

“Life usually does, to boys who read too many books. It’s not whisky. It’s a… suspension. Made from bog myrtle, rowan berries picked at the cross-quarter days, and the tears of a man who genuinely regretted something. Which makes it rarer than diamond dust.” She uncorked it. The smell was overwhelming: peat smoke, crushed green things, and a sharp, coppery tang like blood on the tongue. “You drink this, and for a time, you become a question mark. Your story… resists punctuation. It’s a hiccup in the grammar of reality. Ends slide off you. Conclusions find no purchase.”

“How long?” Isla asked, her eyes on the ominous liquid.

“Long enough to be profoundly irritating,” Morag said. “Not long enough to be safe. It’s a shield, not an armour. And it has a price. While you’re in it, you’re… unfixed. You might remember things that never happened. You might forget your own name. The world might try to write *other* stories on you, just to see what sticks.”

Isla took the bottle. It was warm, as if something inside was fermenting slowly, perpetually. “A living draft,” she murmured.

“Aye. Now, the map.” Morag jabbed a thick finger at the vellum. “It shows the way *to* her door. But her Salon isn’t on the other side of a normal door. It’s in the interstitial glue. The *what-comes-after* of things. To get in, you need to cross a threshold that’s already closed. You need a finality.”

Leo held up the dismantled astrolabe. From its guts, he extracted a delicate, spiralling filament of brass. “A closure key,” he said. “We tune it to a specific, completed story. We use it to unlock a door that only appears once the story is over. Then, we step through into the space that story left behind.”

“What story?” Isla asked.

Leo wouldn’t meet her eye. “Mine.”

He placed a small, cloth-wrapped bundle on the table. Unfolded, it revealed a child’s composition book, its cover stained with what looked like Ribena. A pressed hawthorn flower, brown and fragile, was tucked inside. Next to it, a single, worn-out football sock.

“The story of Leo Henderson,” he said, his voice stripped of its usual academic varnish. “Age eight. Concluded. The boy who believed in magic, who tried to summon a wood-spirit to make his dad come back from his ‘business trip’ in Aberdeen. The boy who failed. The boy who decided, with the absolute finality only a child can muster, that magic was a lie for the desperate, and that the only real things were facts, dates, and catalogues. That story ended. That boy was filed away. This,” he gestured to the pathetic relics, “is the cover of that book. Slammed shut.”

The room held its breath. Isla looked at the relics—not as artefacts, but as tombstones. This was Leo’s void. His mould. He had built his entire adult self, the meticulous archivist, around this one, curated conclusion.

“You’re going to use your own finished story as a ticket,” Isla said, understanding dawning with a cold horror. “You’re going to re-open it.”

“To create a door,” he nodded. “The moment we activate the key with these, a threshold will appear. The threshold of ‘Leo’s Childhood Belief’. It’s a finality. It’s exactly the kind of thing she traffics in. It should get us to the antechamber of her Salon.”

“And then?” Morag asked, her arms crossed.

“Then,” Isla said, picking up the needle once more, “I present my unfinished self. And while she’s… tasting the vintage, I use this. Not on her. On her collection.”

Leo blinked. “What?”

“You said it yourself. She’s the curator. The Salon *is* her. Its integrity is her power. What if I don’t try to stab the curator? What if I… re-catalogue the collection? Introduce an error. File a tragedy under ‘comedies’. Cross-reference a love story with a tax ledger.” She looked at the living map, at the void. “I introduce *draftiness*. A draft in a sealed room causes a terrible stir.”

Morag let out a low whistle. “Now you’re thinking like a proper anarchist, hen. Not breaking the windows, but fucking with the filing system so nothing can ever be found again. That’s a deeper mess.”

They worked through what remained of the day and into the Glasgow night. The *Beatha na h-Òige* was a fire in Isla’s veins, a confusing, vibrant storm. She felt unmoored. She looked at her hand and saw, for a flicker, an old woman’s hand, spotted and thin. She heard a snatch of a lullaby in Morag’s grumble, a song she was certain she’d never heard. She was a sentence missing its full stop, the words beginning to drift and rearrange.

Leo tuned his brass key, the process involving whispered incantations in dog-Latin and the careful heating of the filament over a candle fed with wax from a church dedicated to a deconsecrated saint. The air in the back room grew thick, charged with the scent of juniper, metal, and the cloying sweetness of the *Beatha*.

Finally, it was time. The map was rolled. The needle was sheathed in a lead tube Isla wore on a cord around her neck. The bottle of suspension was half-empty. Isla felt like a walking contradiction, a riot of potential shaped like a woman.

Leo held his childhood relics in one hand, the glowing closure key in the other. He stood in the centre of the room, near the stain on the floorboards that no scrub brush could lift. “This will work,” he said, to himself. “It’s a sound theoretical framework.”

“Theories are like concepts, son,” Morag said, not unkindly. “They just are, or they aren’t.”

He closed his eyes. He whispered a word. A name, perhaps. Isla didn’t catch it.

The key in his hand flared with a soft, gold light. The relics—the book, the flower, the sock—dissolved into motes of dust that swirled around the light, weaving into it. Before them, in the air above the permanent stain, a door began to paint itself.

It was not a solid door. It was the *memory* of a door. The ghost of a door that had once existed in a council house in Easterhouse, the door to a bedroom where a boy had cried himself to sleep and decided to be done with wonder. It was translucent, etched in light and regret. Through it, Isla could see vague shapes—a faded superhero poster, a model aeroplane hanging from a ceiling—but they were insubstantial as mist.

“The threshold of a finality,” Leo breathed, his face etched with a profound, personal pain. He was holding open a wound.

“Go on,” Morag said, giving Isla a shove that was almost gentle. “Before the lad’s heart breaks clean in two.”

Isla stepped forward. The world bent. The smell of *The Hanged Man*—stale beer, bleach, Morag’s perfume—was replaced by the scent of damp plaster, Imperial Leather soap, and the particular, piercing sadness of a hope that has been carefully, deliberately buried.

She passed through the door.

There was no corridor. One step she was in the back room of a pub, the next she was standing on a floor of polished black marble, veined with silver. The air was cool, dry, and utterly silent. It was the silence of a museum after hours, of a library in the dead of night—a silence that felt cultivated, expensive.

She was in a long, narrow gallery. The walls were a matte, dark grey. Set into them at regular intervals were shallow, illuminated niches. Each niche contained a single object, spotlit from above.

To her left, a perfectly ordinary china teacup, with a hairline crack. A card beneath it read: *First Marital Disappointment. J. & M., 1972.*
Further down, a child’s first tooth. *End of Innocence. A., 1998.*
A wedding ring, bent. *The Alternative Life. S., 1984.*
A single, grey woollen glove. *The One Who Got Away. Unknown.*

It was a gallery of endings. Small, personal, devastating finalities. Curated with a chilling, aesthetic precision. The silence here was not empty; it was thick with the echoes of these concluded stories.

Isla walked, the *Beatha* in her blood making her feel like a splash of colour on a greyscale photograph. She was the draft walking amongst the published, leather-bound volumes. She could feel the Salon resisting her presence. The air pushed back, a subtle pressure trying to force her into a narrative shape, to find her file.

At the end of the gallery was an archway, leading into a larger space. The light there was different—warmer, mimicking afternoon sun. She could see the edges of wingback chairs, the glint of glass.

This was the main Salon.

She took a deep breath, her hand finding the lead tube at her neck. She was unfixed. Unfinished. A question.

She stepped through the arch.

The room was a perfect replica of a 19th-century gentleman’s study, if that study had been designed by a god of closure. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves held not books, but objects—thousands of them, each a curated finale. A fire crackled in an immense marble fireplace, though it gave no heat. In a chair by the fire, facing away from her, sat the supervisor.

She was wearing the green shoes. Emerald silk, the exact colour Isla had seen in the reflection.

“You’re late,” the supervisor said, her voice not unkind. It was the voice of a headmistress, a librarian, a surgeon. A voice used to stating facts about irreversible things.

“I’m a draft,” Isla replied, her own voice sounding strange to her, layered with echoes of other women, other possibilities. “Drafts are never late. They just are, or they aren’t.”

The supervisor’s chair slowly swivelled.

Isla had expected many things. A monster. A goddess. A withered crone. The supervisor was none of these. She was a woman in her late fifties, perhaps. Handsome. Severe grey hair swept into a flawless chignon. She wore a tailored suit of charcoal wool. Her face was intelligent, calm, with eyes the colour of flint. She looked like the most formidable academic Isla had ever seen.

“Isla MacLeod,” the supervisor said, looking her up and down. A slight frown touched her lips. “You are… smudged.”

“I’m unfinished.”

“So I see. You have ingested something. A resistance. How very proactive.” She steepled her fingers. “You have brought me a new submission?”

“Myself.”

The supervisor’s flint eyes gleamed with genuine interest. “The living subject as contested text. An intriguing proposal. But ultimately, a flawed one. Every life has an ending. I simply help it find its most… elegant form.” She gestured to the room. “I provide context. Resolution. I take the messy, screaming draft of a life and I give it a full stop. It is a mercy.”

“It’s a theft,” Isla said, the *Beatha* making her bold, her words slipping their leash. “You steal the potential. You trade in might-have-beens.”

“I preserve *what was*,” the supervisor corrected, standing. She moved to a shelf, running a finger along the spine of what looked like a violin with a broken neck. “The might-have-been is a phantom. It causes pain. I am a surgeon of the soul, Ms. MacLeod. I amputate the phantom limb.” She turned, her gaze sharp. “You, for instance. Your phantom limb is your thesis. Your ‘gendered cartography’. It was going nowhere. It was a messy, emotional, *unscholarly* draft. I gave it a clean ending. I filed it under ‘Academic Ambition: Unrealised’. It is at peace now. And you are free to move on to something more suitable.”

The words were meant to cut, to finalise. But Isla felt them slide off the suspension in her blood. They couldn’t find a purchase. “I don’t want peace. I want the mess. I want the draft.”

“Then you are a glutton for suffering.” The supervisor took a step closer. “And you are in the wrong gallery. This is a place for finished works.”

Isla felt the pressure increase. The Salon was trying to edit her. She saw flickers at the edge of her vision—possible Islas. Isla the failed academic, weeping at a library desk. Isla the wife, smiling emptily at a husband. Isla the ghost, haunting *The Hanged Man*. The Salon was offering her endings, trying to bind her into a story she could be filed under.

She clutched the lead tube. It was time.

“You’re wrong,” Isla gasped, fighting the pressure. “The most powerful stories… are the ones without endings. The ones that keep being told. The ones that are drafts forever.”

“A romantic notion,” the supervisor sighed, as if disappointed. “And a false one. Now, let’s see what you really are.”

She reached out a hand, not to touch Isla, but to *pluck* at the air around her. Isla felt a terrifying tug, as if the very narrative of her self was being unspooled.

In that moment of violent attention, Isla yanked the lead tube free, tore out the supervisor’s needle, and instead of driving it forward, she spun and slammed its point into the nearest shelf.

Into a small, framed photograph of a smiling soldier.

The effect was not a explosion, but a dissolution. The photograph didn’t shatter. It *blurred*. The soldier’ smile melted, reformed into a grimace, then a look of confusion. The frame rattled. The card beneath it, which read *Heroic Sacrifice. P., 1944*, flickered. The letters swam, rearranging. *Hesitant Choice… Regretful Duty… Possible Desertion…*

A low shudder ran through the Salon. The fire in the grate guttered.

The supervisor froze, her hand still outstretched. She turned her head, slowly, to look at the shelf. Her flint eyes widened, not with anger, but with a kind of pristine, professional horror.

“What,” she whispered, “have you done?”

Isla was already moving, the needle a dart in her hand. She stabbed it into a pressed rose labelled *First Love*. The rose bloomed, violently, in its case, petals bursting fresh and red, then withering to black dust, then blooming again in a frantic, endless, unresolved cycle.

She touched it to a sealed letter labelled *The Last Word*. The seal broke, the letter unfolded itself, and the words began to rewrite themselves, over and over, in different hands, in conflicting sentiments.

“Stop.” The supervisor’s voice was a crack of ice. The pressure in the room became physical, a weight trying to crush Isla to the floor.

But Isla was draft. She was potential. She slipped through the cracks in the certainty. She was a syntax error in the Salon’s perfect grammar. She ran along the shelves, the needle a wand of chaos, introducing typos, non-sequiturs, and maddening, looping footnotes into the collected works.

A sigh became a scream became a laugh.
A death became a departure became a delay.
A betrayal became a misunderstanding became a secret collaboration.

The Salon was no longer silent. It was a cacophony of rewriting stories, a pandemonium of altered endings. The air shimmered with conflicting narratives. The supervisor stood in the centre, her hands clenched at her sides. Her perfect Salon was unravelling. Her life’s work was being cross-referenced with madness.

“You can’t… this is anarchy!” the supervisor cried, her composure finally fracturing.

“It’s a *new draft*!” Isla shouted back, breathless, leaning against a shelf where a pocket watch labelled *Time Ran Out* was now ticking erratically, forwards and backwards.

The supervisor’s gaze locked onto her. The professional horror was gone, replaced by something raw and furious. “Then you will be the first exhibit I restore. I will finish you myself. I will write your ending in blood and bone, and it will be so final, so absolute, it will be a cornerstone of my new collection.”

She began to walk towards Isla, and as she did, she changed. The severe suit blurred. The handsome face sharpened, grew paler. The green shoes seemed to bleed their colour upwards, until she was clad in a gown of shimmering, venomous emerald silk. Her hair loosened, flowing like smoke. She was no longer the curator. She was the archetype. The Goddess of Closure. Her hands were empty, but Isla knew they could snap a story’s spine with a gesture.

The *Beatha* in Isla’s veins was fading. She could feel it—the unfixed, questioning state was wearing off. The world was beginning to harden around her again, to try and fix her in place. And before this furious, elemental version of the supervisor, a fixed place would be a coffin.

Isla turned and ran, not back towards the gallery of small endings, but deeper into the Salon, into the maze of shelves. The supervisor followed, her passage causing the rewritten stories to whimper and still, as if her very presence re-imposed a temporary, terrible order.

Isla was trapped in a library of endings, being hunted by the librarian. Her resistance was fading. Her draft was about to be submitted.

And in the pocket of her jacket, the living map, responding to the chaos, to the proximity of so much curated finality, grew warm. The void at its centre—the void of the Salon itself—began to pulse. Not like a silence anymore.

Like a heartbeat.

Like an invitation to a deeper, darker precipice.

# Chapter 18

## **CHAPTER 18**

The map in her pocket was a second heart, beating a counter-rhythm to her own frantic pulse. It was not a comfort. It was a demand. The void at its centre, the Salon’s own curated absence, had become a black star, pulling at her. Isla ran, her boots whispering over the marble that was no longer cold but fever-warm, as if the Salon were alive with a sickly, institutional heat.

Behind her, the susurration of emerald silk was a sound like pages being torn, one after another. The supervisor—no, the *Curator* now, in her true aspect—did not hurry. She walked. Her pace was the implacable advance of a final chapter. The air around her grew heavy, settled, *resolved*. Isla felt the *Beatha*’s last, defiant question in her blood being answered by that presence, a flat, declarative ‘no’.

“You cannot outrun a conclusion, Isla,” the Curator’s voice echoed, not loud, but perfectly clear, as if spoken inside Isla’s own skull. It had shed its bureaucratic crispness. It was a voice of velvet-wrapped stone. “Every path here leads to an end. You are merely choosing the scenery for yours.”

The maze of shelves turned treacherous. Where before they had held a chaotic potential, now they seemed to align against her. A shelf labelled *Lovers Parted by War* swung out, forcing her to stumble into an aisle where the air was thick with the scent of cordite and forgotten perfume. A case of *Small, Unmarked Graves* seemed to lengthen before her, its dirt-caked exhibits whispering of quiet, anonymous surrender. The Salon was no longer a repository. It was an instrument, and the Curator was its player.

Isla’s breath sawed in her throat. The *Beatha* was gone, fully metabolised into a crashing fatigue. The glorious, unfixed state—the ability to be a question mark in a world of full stops—had evaporated. She was solidifying. With every step, her own story felt more written, the margins narrowing. She could feel the weight of her own past decisions, her academic failures, her flight from Glasgow, settling on her shoulders like a leaden shawl. The Curator’s gift was to make you see your life not as a narrative, but as an argument—and one you were losing.

She ducked into a cul-de-shelf marked *Domestic Dissolutions*. The air here was close, smelling of stale tea and unsaid words. Miniature dioramas showed couples frozen at kitchen tables, their silence a tangible, jagged thing. Isla pressed her back against the wood, the living map burning against her thigh. Its pulse said: *deeper, go deeper*. The void was not just at the Salon’s heart. It was a potential in her own chest. A way out, or a way in.

The emerald silk whispered to a halt at the aisle entrance.

“There you are,” the Curator murmured. Isla risked a glance. The goddess stood silhouetted, her form both terribly sharp and unnervingly fluid. Her hands were held before her, fingers moving as if she were knitting with invisible yarn. With each motion, the aisle behind Isla seemed to grow shorter, the shelves at its end sealing together with a soft, final *click* like a book closing. “This one has a certain aptness, don’t you think? Not with a bang, but a whimper. The slow, quiet ending that happens in rooms everyone has left.”

Isla’s mind, trained for patterns, for the architecture of unseen things, scrabbled. The Curator was closure. She was the period, the full stop, the ‘The End’ stitched in gold thread. Her power was narrative finality. Isla had fought with chaos, with the draft, with the un-made. And she had lost. The *Beatha* was a temporary rebellion. This was the eternal regime.

But the map beat on. *Void. Precipice.*

And then she saw it—not with her eyes, but with the part of her that had always mapped the spaces between what was said and what was meant. The Curator’s power was absolute, but it had a grammar. It was *declarative*. It stated. It concluded. It was the voice of the published text, the mounted exhibit, the verdict. It was the voice that had dismissed her thesis, that had filed Morag away as a colourful anecdote, that had tried to fix Finch as a doddering fool. It was a masculine grammar wearing a feminine gown. It imposed order. It did not *listen*.

Isla had nothing left to declare. But she could still ask.

She pushed away from the shelf, standing straight in the dead-end aisle. She did not face the Curator with defiance, but with a raw, exhausted curiosity. Her voice, when it came, was not a shout, but a rasping question.

“Why do you get to choose the ending?”

The Curator’s knitting fingers stilled. A faint line appeared between her brows. The question was a pebble dropped into the still pond of her certainty. It was an improper form.

“It is my function,” the Curator stated. “My nature. I am the resolution of all narratives brought here.”

“Says who?” Isla asked, another question, stepping forward. The weight on her lessened, just a fraction. She was not arguing the conclusion. She was questioning the premise. “Who made you the arbiter? Who gave you the pen?”

“I *am* the pen,” the Curator said, but her tone had shifted minutely from statement to explanation. A crack in the grammar.

“No,” Isla said, understanding dawning like a cold, terrible light. “You’re the hand that holds it. But the hand was taught. Who taught you to end stories this way? To pin them down, to drain the blood out and leave the pretty, mounted husk?” She took another step. The domestic dioramas around her seemed to lean in, their silent couples listening. “You end every romance with a parting or a death. Every quest with a hollow prize or a fallen hero. Every rebellion with a crushing defeat or a corrupted victory. It’s so… *predictable*. It’s not closure. It’s just a tired habit.”

The Curator’s face, a masterpiece of composed finality, flickered. For an instant, Isla saw not a goddess, but the furious, handsome supervisor, over-invested in her cataloguing. “I impose meaning on chaos. I give them shape. Without my ending, they are nothing. Noise.”

“Without *your* ending, they might become something else,” Isla pressed. The map was a furnace now. The void-pulse synced with her own heart. She was at the precipice. “You don’t finish stories. You *interrupt* them. You see a woman running and you call it a flight, never a pursuit. You see a woman asking questions and you call it a flaw, never a method. You see a woman like Morag, who lives in the glorious, messy draft of her own life, and you’d file her under ‘Local Colour’ and close the drawer. You’re not the goddess of endings. You’re the goddess of *interruptions*. And you were hired for the job.”

The air trembled. The shelves rattled. The Curator’s emerald gown seemed to dim. “You dare…”

“I *question*,” Isla snarled, finding a last reservoir of strength in the act. It was her only weapon. It was the one thing the declarative voice could not assimilate. “Who built this place? Who set the rules? Was it a ‘he’? Was it a man who thought stories were things to be solved, like equations, and who thought women in stories were problems to be resolved—by marriage, by death, by silence?”

The accusation hung in the thick air. The Curator did not move, but Isla saw the truth in the sudden, perfect stillness. It was a confirmation. This place, this terrible, beautiful library of finalities, was built on a foundation of a single, arrogant assumption: that a story was a possession to be completed, not a conversation to be had. And the Curator, for all her power, was its chief librarian, enforcing a canon she did not create.

It was a false victory, this understanding. It did not disarm the goddess. It enraged her.

The flicker of doubt vanished, swallowed by a tsunami of cold, professional wrath. “You insignificant *draft*,” the Curator whispered. The words were ice. “You think your critique matters? You think naming the architect changes the prison? I am the law here. And your insubordination merits a definitive edit.”

Her hands came up, not knitting now, but shaping—as if she were crumpling a sheet of paper. The space around Isla began to compress. The air itself hardened, pressing in on her ribs, seeking to fix her final pose: crouched, defeated, in a dead-end aisle. This was not a narrative ending anymore. This was a deletion.

The pressure was immense. Isla’s bones groaned. She couldn’t breathe. The world became a narrowing tunnel, and at its end was the Curator’s cold, finalising gaze. She had seen the deeper truth, and it had shattered any hope of reprieve. The system was rigged. The house always won. The critic with the pen always got the last word.

Her hand, crushed against her side, felt the map. It wasn’t just warm; it was vibrating, a hum that travelled up her arm. The void at its centre wasn’t pulsing. It was *gaping*.

The Curator’s ending was a wall. The void was a hole.

There was no choice. To be fixed here was to become an exhibit. A little diorama: *The Girl Who Asked Too Much*. Preserved forever in the moment of her silencing.

Isla stopped resisting the pressure. Instead, with the last of her will, she reached into her pocket and wrapped her fingers around the living map. She didn’t pull it out. She *pushed* into it. She focused not on the inked lines of Edinburgh, but on the perfect, consuming blackness at its heart—the representation of the Salon’s own un-recorded core.

She offered it a question, her final one: *What’s in the dark?*

The map answered.

The void erupted. It did not swallow her; it unfolded. The pressure, the aisle, the shelves of *Domestic Dissolutions*, the emerald glow of the Curator—all of it tore like wet paper. Isla fell, but not down. *In*. Into the heartbeat.

There was a sound like a universe sighing, and then there was silence. Not the curated silence of the Salon, but a deep, primeval quiet. And darkness.

She landed on her hands and knees. The surface was not marble, nor earth. It was soft, cool, and slightly resilient, like packed ash. The air was still and scentless. The oppressive, narrative weight of the Salon was gone. In its place was a profound, unsettling neutrality.

Isla gasped, drawing breath into her aching lungs. She was unfixed again, but not by the *Beatha*. This was different. This was not a state of potential, but a state of *absence*. She looked up.

She was in the heart of the Salon. The void on the map.

It was not a room. It was a cavern, so vast the ceiling and walls were lost in a gloom that seemed to drink the light. And the light came from the only features in the emptiness: thousands upon thousands of faint, shimmering threads. They hung from the unseen ceiling, drifting gently like ghostly kelp in a still sea. Each thread glowed with a soft, dying light—silver, gold, pale blue, rose. At the end of each thread, suspended a few feet above the ashen floor, was an object.

A single, frozen tear. A wedding ring, cracked in two. A key, bent beyond use. A child’s wooden soldier, its paint worn away. A lock of hair, grey and braided. A fountain pen, snapped. A symphony score with the final bar missing.

Isla stood, her legs trembling. She walked slowly, her boots making no sound on the ash. She passed under a thread from which dangled a pair of spectacles, one lens shattered. From another, a dried sprig of heather. From another, a soldier’s medal, green with tarnish.

This was not the gallery of endings. This was the repository of what was *cut*. The moments deemed too messy, too unresolved, too *un-final* for the Curator’s collections. The discarded drafts of emotion. The ambiguous moments that refused to cohere into a clean moral. The unanswered questions. The tears shed not in catharsis, but in confusion. The love that did not end in marriage or death, but simply… changed. The courage that looked like fear. The defiance that looked like silence.

This was the subtext the Curator’s narratives had erased. The *her*story filed under ‘irrelevant’.

And at the very centre of this forest of severed threads, there was a clearer space. A single thread hung there, thicker than the others, glowing with a weak, stubborn light. It was not silver or gold, but the colour of old whisky. At its end was not an object, but a small, shimmering, amorphous cloud—a condensation of memory and feeling. As Isla approached, she heard a faint echo, a voice both familiar and almost forgotten: *“The whisky was a peat-bog ghost, haunting the glass…”*

Her own voice. The opening line of her own story, the one she’d lived since Glasgow. It was here. Suspended. Unfinished.

A soft footfall echoed in the ash.

Isla turned.

She was not alone in the void.

A figure sat on a low, rough-hewn stool made of dark wood, beside a thread from which hung a thimble. She was mending a shawl, her needle moving in and out of the grey wool with a slow, timeless rhythm. She was old, older than Morag, her face a landscape of gentle wrinkles, her hair a long, silver cascade over her shoulders. She wore simple clothes of undyed wool. Her eyes, when she looked up, were the colour of a winter sky just before snow.

“She cannot come here,” the old woman said. Her voice was the sound of pages being turned softly, one at a time. “Closure has no jurisdiction in the Unfinished.”

“Who are you?” Isla asked, her voice small in the immense quiet.

“I have had many names in many stories,” the woman said, returning to her mending. “The One Who Remembers. The Keeper of Loose Ends. The Spinner Who Unravels. You might call me the Archivists’ Neglect.” A faint, sorrowful smile touched her lips. “I am what she edits out.”

Isla looked around at the hanging threads, the galaxy of cut moments. “All of this?”

“All of this. Every emotion that did not fit the arc. Every character who refused their assigned role. Every middle that was too interesting to be resolved. She harvests the endings, but she is wasteful. She throws away the best parts.” The old woman knotted her thread and bit it off with teeth that were still strong and white. “The doubts. The questions. The ‘what ifs’. They have a power she does not understand. A sustaining power.”

“They’re… alive?”

“In a manner of speaking. They are *potential*. A story that is truly finished is dead. It is a specimen. But a story with a loose thread…” She gestured to the forest around them. “It can yet be pulled. It can unravel. It can become something else.”

Isla looked at the whisky-coloured thread, her thread. “Why is mine here?”

“Because you are a question, Isla MacLeod. You always have been. Your thesis was a question. Your flight was a question. Your draft was a glorious, chaotic question. She could not end you because she could not *answer* you. So she was going to delete you. A messy, inelegant solution to a problem she could not categorise.” The old woman set her mending aside. “But you asked the right question of the map. You asked what was in the dark. And the dark is where she does not look. It is beneath her notice.”

A terrible, wonderful hope began to ache in Isla’s chest. “Can I leave? Can I get out of the Salon?”

“You already are ‘out’,” the woman said. “You are in the place she built this palace upon, and then sealed away. The foundation of all stories. The muddle. The draft.” She stood, her movements fluid. “But you cannot stay. The Unfinished is not a place for the living. It is a limbo. To stay is to become a thread yourself—a beautiful, suspended potential that never touches the world.”

“Then what do I do?”

The old woman walked to Isla’s thread. She did not touch it, but she breathed upon the shimmering cloud at its end. The cloud solidified, just for a moment, into an image: Morag, behind the bar of *The Hanged Man*, polishing a glass. She looked up, directly at Isla, and winked.

“You pull the thread,” the old woman said. “You pick up your own story. But you must do it consciously. You must take all of this with you.” She swept a hand around the cavern. “Not the objects. The *principle*. The question. The right to be unresolved. The courage of the loose end. If you go back out there with only your own anger, she will crush you. Her grammar is too strong. But if you go out carrying the weight of all she has discarded… you become something new. You are no longer a draft.”

“What am I?”

“A counter-narrative.”

The words hung in the ash-scented air. Isla looked from the old woman’s calm, winter-grey eyes to the countless glowing threads. She thought of all the stories trimmed to fit, all the lives edited for coherence, all the women forced into endings that were not their own. The weight of it was oceanic. It would crush her.

“I can’t,” she whispered.

“You already are,” the old woman replied. “You walked in here. You saw her truth. You carry the *Beatha* in your memory, and the map in your hand. You are a scholar of liminal spaces. This…” She gestured to the void. “This is the ultimate liminal space. The space *between the lines*. Your thesis was not wrong. It was just… small.”

Isla laughed, a short, desperate sound. It echoed among the threads, and some of them brightened in response. The sound of unresolved laughter.

“How?” she asked.

The old woman pointed to the floor at Isla’s feet. The ash was stirring. It was not being blown by any wind, but was moving of its own accord, swirling and rising. It coalesced, not into an object, but into a shape. A door. A simple, wooden doorframe, standing freely in the ash. Through it, Isla saw not the cavern, but a blur of other places, other times—a rain-slicked Glasgow street, the heather on a hillside, the warm, peat-smoke gloom of *The Hanged Man*. The door was a question made manifest.

“Walk through,” the old woman said. “But do not go to a place. Go to a *moment*. A moment that was not an ending. A moment that was a beginning disguised as something else. Your thread will follow you. And the others… they will know. They will resonate.”

Isla stepped towards the door. She placed her hand on the rough wood of the frame. It felt real. Solid. An anchor.

She looked back at the Keeper of Loose Ends. “What will happen to you? When I go?”

The old woman had retrieved her mending. She smiled, and this time it was a smile of deep, timeless satisfaction. “I will continue my work. She will continue hers. It is the oldest story. But perhaps, if you are loud enough, if your counter-narrative is sufficiently… *irritating*… she will drop more threads. My collection will grow.”

Isla nodded. She turned to the door. She thought not of escape, but of a specific moment. The moment in the Glasgow pub, after Finch’s letter, when Morag had slid the glass of whisky towards her and said, *“Concepts are never late. They just are, or they aren’t.”* It was not an answer. It was a permission slip.

She took a deep breath of the scentless air, and stepped through the door.

The world did not spin. It *stitched*.

One moment she was in the ash-filled void, the next she was standing in the middle of an aisle in the Salon of Finality. But it was not the same.

The emerald glow of the Curator was before her, the goddess’s hands outstretched, frozen in the act of crumpling the space where Isla had just been. Her face was a mask of triumphant finality. Time had not passed. Isla’s flight into the void, her conversation, had happened in a space between seconds.

Isla stood, solid, real. The map in her pocket was cool and inert, its work done. But she was different. She felt the weight the old woman had spoken of—not a burden, but a density. She carried the silence of the void within her. She was a walking loose end.

The Curator’s eyes focused. The triumph shattered into pure, unprofessional shock. “You… you are *fixed*. You should be…”

“I am,” Isla said. Her voice was quiet, but it did not echo. It absorbed sound. “I’m fixed as a question. A question with consequences.”

She did not attack. She did not run. She simply began to walk, not away from the Curator, but past her, down the aisle towards the heart of the Salon. And as she walked, she did what the Curator could not. She *listened*.

She listened to the whimper of the rewritten stories on the shelves. But now, she heard not just their pain, but their stubborn, unfinished core—the love that remained in the betrayal, the hope that lingered in the defeat. She heard the subtext.

And the Salon heard *her*.

Where her feet touched the marble, the perfect, glossy surface grew faint lines, like cracks, or like the beginnings of handwriting. The shelves she passed shuddered. A book labelled *The Hero’s Fall* fell open, and a new paragraph, messy and ink-smudged, began to write itself at the bottom of the final page. A diorama of *The Bitter Parting* flickered, and for a second, the two figures turned not away from each other, but looked back, their faces etched with a complicated regret that was not an ending, but a change.

The Curator stared, aghast. “Stop.” The word was a command, but it cracked in the middle.

Isla did not stop. She was pulling her thread. And hers was not the only one. A faint, silver light began to seep from the shelves, from the cases, from the very air. It was the light from the void, leaking back into the finished world. Loose ends seeking their stories.

“You are contaminating the collection!” the Curator shrieked. The goddess aspect was fraying, revealing the furious, meticulous bureaucrat beneath. She raised her hands, not to knit or crumple, but to claw. She lunged at Isla, her fingers aimed to tear, to physically rend this anomaly from her perfect system.

Isla turned to face her. She did not raise her hands in defence. She just looked at the Curator, and in her winter-grey eyes (had they always been that colour?) was the patience of the ash, the silence of the void, the immense, quiet weight of everything the Curator had ever thrown away.

The Curator’s clawing hands stopped an inch from Isla’s face. They trembled. She could not touch her. Isla was no longer a story to be ended. She was a condition. A critical footnote that had swollen to consume the text.

“You’re not the author,” Isla said softly. “You’re just a critic with a very sharp pen.”

She turned and walked on, leaving the Curator standing, frozen, in an aisle that was now subtly, irrevocably *unfinished*.

Isla walked towards the centre of the Salon, following the now-warm pulse of her own thread. She knew where it led. Not out. Not yet. To the source. To the place where her story had been intercepted, where the Curator had first tried to write her ending. She had a debt to pay, and a draft to recover.

Around her, the Salon of Finality whispered with new, unapproved potential. Endings were unspooling into middles. The grammar was breaking down.

And high above, in her office of polished despair, the Curator lowered her shaking hands. She looked at them as if they were foreign objects. Then she looked at the spreading stain of ambiguity infecting her perfect aisles. A single, perfect tear of rage—a tear that would have made a beautiful, definitive exhibit—welled in her eye. But before it could fall, it hesitated. It held within it a flicker of doubt, a terrifying, unresolved question: *What if I am wrong?*

It was the first loose thread in her own impeccable story.

She blinked it away, viciously. But it was too late. The thread had been spun. It hung in the air between heartbeats, a tiny, shimmering filament of chaos.

She turned her gaze towards the retreating back of Isla MacLeod, a figure now glowing faintly with borrowed void-light, walking into the heart of the museum.

“This,” the Curator whispered, the word a vow, a curse, and a promise, “is not over.”

But for the first time in eternity, it sounded less like a statement of fact, and more like a hope.

# Chapter 19

## **CHAPTER 19**

The centre of the Salon of Finality was not a place, but a process. A slow, cold digestion. Isla walked towards it, the soles of her boots making no sound on the marble that was now the colour of a fading bruise. The void-light she carried was not an illumination; it was an exposure. It did not show things as they were, but as they had been interrupted. The polished cases lining the aisles gleamed with a sickly, hesitant sheen. Within them, the curated endings—the knight’s last breath, the city’s final stone, the love letter’s unread signature—stirred. Not with life, but with the memory of motion. A suspended animation was thawing into a terrible, unresolved present participle.

Her own thread, warm and insistent as a vein in her wrist, pulled her onward. It did not lead to a grand arch or a vaulted dome. It led to a service door. A plain, grey metal door set into an alcove, so mundane it was the most shocking thing in the museum. The label beside it, in small, functional type, read: *Acquisitions & Initial Processing*.

This was where stories were brought to be stripped. Before they were mounted, before they were labelled, this was the abattoir of narrative.

The door was unlocked. It opened onto a corridor of sterile white tile and humming fluorescent lights. The smell was antiseptic, overlaying something older and more metallic. The silence here was different from the hush of the galleries. This was the silence of a vacuum jar, of something being held in perfect, airless stillness. The Curator’s aesthetic of beautiful despair did not extend back here. This was pure function. This was the machinery behind the art.

Isla’s thread trembled, a plucked string, and led her to a room on the left.

It was a laboratory. Or a taxidermist’s workshop. Steel tables ran down its centre, under the glare of surgical lamps. On one table lay the gossamer ghost of a covenant between kingdoms, pinned at its corners by crystal weights, a scalpel resting beside a clause that had been deemed ‘redundant’. On another, the shimmering, liquid shadow of a forgotten sea god was being siphoned into a series of glass vials, each labelled with a date of irrelevance. The tools were not hammers and chisels, but fine-tuned instruments of critique, of deconstruction: a thesaurus that replaced vibrant words with pallid synonyms, a set of calipers for measuring emotional resonance, a silver needle and thread for suturing shut plot holes with elegant, suffocating closure.

At the far end of the room, under the brightest light, was her story.

It was laid out like a patient on an autopsy slab. Not the physical manuscript from her bag—that was gone, consumed—but the living shape of it. She saw the topography of her thesis, the rolling hills of her research on the *bean nighe* and the *gruagach*, the sharp cliffs of her arguments about gendered passage. She saw the coastline of her personal journey, the inlets of grief for her mother, the stubborn headlands of her own defiance. It was all there, rendered in faint, gold-and-silver light, a shimmering cartography pinned to the steel.

And it had been edited.

Black lines, thick and final as tar, scored through entire passages. Margins were filled with a tight, vicious script that she recognized from the Curator’s labels: *Sentimental. Derivative. Structurally unsound. Inconsequential.* A great, black ‘X’ had been drawn over the entire central chapter—the chapter about her mother’s stories, about the way women pass knowledge not in books, but in whispers, in lullabies, in the quiet shaping of bread dough. That chapter was marked: *Anecdotal. Lacks rigour. The personal is not universal.*

But they had not finished. A long, silver instrument, like a poet’s stylus dipped in ink made of nothingness, hovered over the final section. The conclusion. Where she had dared to suggest that a liminal space, traditionally a place of danger for women, could be re-mapped as a place of agency. That the door left ajar could be a threshold one *chose* to cross, not a trap one fell into. The stylus was poised to write the ultimate critique: *THE END.*

Isla did not shout. She did not run. She walked to the table, her void-light flaring, pushing back against the sterile glare. She placed her hands on the cold steel, on either side of her shimmering, condemned story.

“I’ll be taking that back,” she said, her voice calm in the humming room.

The stylus did not move. But from the shadows behind the table, a figure resolved. Not the Curator. This was a Preservationist. A tall, slender being in a dove-grey smock, its face a smooth, androgynous oval devoid of features save for two dark lenses where eyes might be. It held the stylus with long, delicate fingers. It did not speak. It tilted its head, the lenses focusing on Isla, then on the void-light that haloed her. A low, clicking sound emanated from it, like a clockwork beetle assessing a threat.

*It is scheduled for termination,* a voice said, not in the air, but directly inside Isla’s mind. The voice was dry, precise, and cold. *The analysis is complete. The narrative is flawed. Its preservation would introduce instability.*

“Your analysis is wrong,” Isla said, meeting the blank lenses. “You measured the wrong things. You looked for universals in the particulars. You searched for rigour in the rhythm of a breath.”

*The metrics are absolute. Emotion is a variable to be controlled. Personal history is bias. This narrative is a failed draft.*

“It’s not a draft,” Isla said, her fingers curling against the steel. “It’s a testament. And it’s mine.”

She reached for the shimmering map of her story. Her hands passed through the light. It was like dipping them into a cold stream. She felt the texture of her own thoughts, the ache of her research, the warmth of her mother’s voice woven through the text. She began to gather it, not to roll it up like a scroll, but to *re-collect* it. To pull it back into the vessel of herself.

The Preservationist moved. It was faster than thought. The silver stylus lanced down, not towards the story, but towards Isla’s hands, aiming to pin them to the table with a period of final pain.

Isla did not pull back. She turned her right hand, the one that had plunged into the void, the one still faintly streaming with borrowed negation. She caught the stylus.

There was no clash. No spark. The stylus, designed to inscribe endings onto the essence of things, met the void-light and… hesitated. It could not find a purchase. It could not define the edge of Isla’s hand. She was, in that moment, an unended thing. A woman in the middle of her sentence.

She tightened her grip. The void-light swirled up the stylus, a creeping frost of anti-meaning. The Preservationist made a sound like a shattering wine glass inside her skull. It released the tool and stumbled back, its blank lenses flickering with static, with chaotic, unprocessed data.

Isla took the stylus. It was heavier than it looked, dense with intent. She looked at it, then at her story on the table. Then she did not break the stylus. She did not throw it away.

She used it.

Leaning over the table, she began to write. Not in the margins. Not as a correction. She wrote directly over the black, tar-like deletions. She wrote with the void-light that now infused the instrument, a silver-black ink that did not obscure, but *converted*. Where the Curator had written *Sentimental*, Isla wrote ** *Felt*. Where *Derivative* was scrawled, she inscribed * *Inherited*. Over *Structurally unsound*, she layered * *Built to withstand*. She wrote not in sentences, but in pulses. In breaths. She wrote the memory of Morag’s aubergine hair and battle-cloth. She wrote the taste of peat-bog ghost whisky at ten in the morning. She wrote the weight of the *geata* stone in her pocket, and the sound of a man who was a concept laughing softly in a dusty office.

She was not repairing her thesis. She was fortifying it. She was grafting the living, uncurated details of her journey—the very details the Curator would discard as clutter—back into its bones. She was making it *specific*. She was making it *hers*.

And as she wrote, the story on the table changed. The gold-and-silver light deepened, gaining the warmth of honey and the cool sheen of a Glasgow rain. The black scoring lines didn’t vanish; they became part of the texture, the scars that proved a thing had been fought for. The map of her story grew, not in size, but in depth. It became less an argument to be assessed, and more a territory to be inhabited.

The Preservationist watched, its internal mechanisms emitting a low, distressed whine. It could not process this. This was not editing. This was contamination. This was a narrative refusing its assigned category.

From the doorway, a voice spoke. It was not the dry, mental voice of the Preservationist. It was a voice of polished despair, now cracked with a hairline fracture of fury.

“Stop.”

The Curator stood in the threshold. She was immaculate, her suit sharp, her hair a frozen wave. But the single, perfect tear she had blinked away in the gallery had left a track. A tiny, almost invisible line down the powder on her cheek, like the first crack in a porcelain mask. In her hands, she held a new tool. It looked like a pair of shears, but the blades were made of crystallized silence, and the handles were wrapped in the leather of old, forgotten prologues.

“You are vandalizing a catalogued item,” the Curator said, her voice trembling with the effort of control.

Isla finished her last inscription. She straightened up, the void-stylus still in her hand. Her story, now glowing with a robust, defiant light, lifted from the table of its own accord and floated towards her, folding itself seamlessly back into her chest, into the space behind her ribs. It was not gone. It was integrated. She felt its weight, not as a burden, but as a foundation.

“It was never yours to catalogue,” Isla said. “You collect endings. I am in my middle.”

The Curator’s eyes flickered to the Preservationist, still shuddering in the corner. “You have infected my staff. You have introduced… variables.” She said the word like it was a disease. “This cannot be borne.”

“Then don’t bear it,” Isla said, taking a step forward. “Let it go. Your museum is a beautiful, terrible lie. You don’t preserve stories. You embalm them. You trade in the comfort of the full stop because you’re terrified of the ellipsis.”

The Curator’s knuckles whitened on the shears. “The ellipsis is chaos. It is suffering without resolution. It is hope deferred until it becomes a kind of torture. I offer peace. I offer certainty.”

“You offer a cage,” Isla shot back. “You saw my mother’s story—a woman waiting, a man lost at sea—and you called it a ‘quintessential tragedy of feminine patience.’ You pinned it like a butterfly. You never asked if her patience was active. If her waiting was a form of navigation. You never saw the stories she told me in the meantime, the world she built in the ellipsis. You just saw the ending you expected.”

For the first time, the Curator’s composure slipped. Not into rage, but into a flash of something raw and bewildered. “It… it is the cleaner narrative.”

“It’s the simpler one,” Isla corrected, her voice softening, almost pitying. “You’re not a guardian of stories. You’re a critic with a god complex. And you’re lonely. So lonely you’ve made a heaven out of a cemetery.”

The barb struck home. The Curator flinched as if struck. The crack in her mask widened. The shears in her hands lowered, just a fraction.

“I am order,” she whispered, but it sounded like a question.

“You’re a sentence,” Isla said. “A beautiful, perfectly-constructed, dead sentence.”

Isla moved then, not towards the Curator, but past her, towards the door. She had what she came for. More than she came for. The void-light around her was fading, its energy spent in the re-writing. She was just a woman again, but a woman who had reclaimed her own text.

The Curator did not move to stop her. She stood, holding her shears of crystallized silence, staring at the now-empty autopsy table. Staring at the space where a flawed, inconsequential story had been, and where now only the impression of its defiant, messy, unresolved life remained.

As Isla reached the corridor, the Curator spoke again, her voice hollow, echoing in the sterile room.

“Where will you go? This is all there is. The Salon of Finality is the last room in the house of existence.”

Isla paused at the threshold. She looked back, not at the Curator, but at the grey metal door to the galleries beyond. She thought of the *geata* stone, warm against her leg. She thought of the thread in her chest, which now pulsed with a new, forward momentum. Not back the way she came, but *onward*.

“You’re wrong,” Isla said, and her voice held the ghost of a smile, the first true one in what felt like centuries. “You told me yourself. This is a museum of *literary* endings. You only collect the ones that have been written down.”

She met the Curator’s wide, shattered eyes.

“My story isn’t finished being lived.”

She walked out into the corridor, leaving the Curator standing amidst the tools of her trade, the shears hanging uselessly at her side. The Curator looked at the Preservationist, who was now slowly, mechanically, trying to clean the empty table, wiping away the lingering resonance of Isla’s presence. It was a futile task. The resonance was not a stain. It was a scent. A perfume of peat smoke, whisky, and unresolved potential.

It would not come out.

The Curator’s gaze drifted to the doorway through which Isla had disappeared. The vow, the curse, the promise, died on her lips. All that was left was the terrifying, unresolved question, now grown too loud to blink away. It echoed in the silent, sterile room, in the humming of the lights, in the very marrow of her polished bones.

*What if I am wrong?*

***

The main gallery was different. The whisper had become a murmur. The aisles were no longer straight. They curved, subtly, as if around an unseen gravity. Exhibits were not quite as they had been. The knight’s final breath now seemed to hitch, as if on the verge of a second word. The city’s last stone had a hairline fracture, from which a tiny, stubborn shoot of something green and impossible was trying to emerge.

Isla paid them no mind. Her own thread was a compass needle, pulling her not towards the grand entrance, but deeper into the heart of the museum, towards a wing the Curator’s map had labelled *Restricted: Proto-Narratives & Unrealized Potential*.

The door to this wing was not grey metal. It was old oak, blackened with age, bound in iron that was red with rust. It was ajar.

On the threshold, Isla stopped. She could feel it. A draft. Not of air, but of *possibility*. It smelled of damp earth, of ozone before a storm, of ink not yet dry on a page. It was the smell of a story just beginning.

She looked back once. The Salon of Finality stretched behind her, its perfect order now softly, irrevocably warped. The Curator was nowhere to be seen. She was in her office, perhaps, staring at a single, hesitant tear, watching her world become ambiguous.

Isla turned her back on the endings. She pushed the oak door open.

Beyond was not a gallery. It was a landscape.

A twilight moor stretched before her, shrouded in mist that glowed with a soft, internal light. The sky was a deep, velvety purple, shot through with threads of silver like unspooled plotlines. In the distance, hills rolled like the spines of great, slumbering beasts. The path under her feet was not marble, but packed earth and heather. The air was cold, and alive.

This was the place before the story. The place of first inspiration, of gathering clouds, of the first note of a tune that had no name yet. It was chaos, but a fertile chaos. It was the rough draft of reality.

And there, in the middle of the path, waiting for her, was a figure.

He was sitting on a large, moss-covered stone, smoking a pipe. The smoke curled up into the mist, forming vague, shifting shapes—a castle, a ship, a face that melted into another. He wore a tweed jacket that was more patch than original fabric, and his eyes held the weary, knowing glint of a man who had read too many first chapters and not enough last pages.

It was Professor Alistair Finch. Or rather, it was the *concept* of him, the essence that had written the letter on pressed-bone paper. Here, in this place of raw potential, he was more real than he had ever been in *The Hanged Man*.

He took the pipe from his mouth and smiled, a network of wrinkles spreading like a map around his eyes.

“Took your time, hen,” he said, his voice the sound of pages turning in a quiet room. “I was starting to think you’d accepted the footnotes.”

Isla walked towards him, the weight of her reclaimed story solid and sure inside her. “I had some editing to do.”

He chuckled, nodding. “I can see that. You’ve got the look of a woman who’s just rewritten her own terms of engagement.” He gestured with his pipe stem towards the vast, murmuring moor behind him. “Welcome to the rough copy. Bit messy. Full of false starts and abandoned subplots. But it’s where the work is done.”

“Is this the way out?” Isla asked, though she already sensed the answer was more complex.

“Out?” Finch mused. “This isn’t a prison, lass. It’s a library. The Salon is one reading room. This… this is the writer’s shed. The way *on*.” He looked at her, his gaze piercing. “Your thread led you here. Not to an exit, but to a beginning. Specifically, I believe, to hers.”

He pointed.

There, by a small, dark pool that reflected the silver-threaded sky, stood a woman.

She was tall, with hair the colour of winter fire, streaked with ash. She wore simple, sturdy clothes, and she was staring into the water, her expression not one of sorrow, but of fierce, concentrated contemplation. In her hand, she held not a pen, but a smooth, grey stone from the shore.

Isla’s breath caught. She knew her. From a dozen half-remembered lullabies, from the shape left in a chair by the fire, from the feeling of hands braiding her hair.

It was her mother. Not as she was at the end, waiting. But as she was in her own middle. A woman in the process of inventing herself, of weaving a world from the threads of loss and landscape. This was the author of the stories that had shaped Isla’s bones. This was the source.

The debt was here. The draft to recover was not on paper. It was in this woman’s hands, in the story she was about to cast, like a stone, into the pool of the unrealized.

“She’s why you’re here,” Finch said softly. “Not to save her. You can’t. Her ending, in one form, is already written. But to *witness* her. To carry forward the story she began but never got to finish living. The Curator took that from you. From her. She tried to make it a closed loop. A tragedy.”

He knocked his pipe out against the stone. The embers died with a hiss.

“You have a choice, Isla MacLeod. You can take your reclaimed story and find a way back to your own world. It will be changed. You will be changed. But you can go. Or…”

He nodded towards the woman by the pool.

“You can step into the rough draft. You can meet her. Not as a daughter to a mother, but as one storyteller to another. You can learn the question she was asking before the world wrote its answer for her. And you can carry *that* question home.”

Isla looked at her mother’s back, straight and strong against the vast twilight. She felt the warm pulse of her own thread, now stretching taut, connecting her to that figure by the water. It was not a thread of fate. It was a thread of understanding. A bridge across time, built not from grief, but from craft.

The Curator had believed every story had one true, final shape. Isla now knew that was the greatest fiction of all.

She turned to Finch. “If I go to her… can I come back?”

He smiled, a sad, wise smile. “Every choice is a door, hen. Some you can’t close once opened. This place… it gets into your blood. It’s the addiction of the unwritten. You might find the way back to your Glasgow. Or you might find you’ve outgrown it. That your story needs a bigger sky.”

Isla looked at her hands. One still faintly shimmered with the afterglow of the void. The other was just a hand, capable of holding a pen, of touching a stone, of reaching out.

She had come to recover a draft. She had found the source.

High above, in a tower of polished despair that was now reflected in a pool of primal potential, the Curator watched from a window that was not there. She saw Isla hesitate on the threshold of the moor. She saw the woman by the pool. And she felt, for the first time, not the satisfaction of an ending, but the terrifying, exhilarating pull of a *prelude*.

The single, perfect tear finally fell. It traced the crack in her mask and dropped, not onto a ledger, but into the palm of her own hand. It was warm. It was alive. It was the first sentence of a story she had never dared to tell.

Down on the twilight path, Isla MacLeod made her choice.

She took a step forward, off the path and onto the heather, towards the pool, towards the woman, towards the unwritten question that had always been waiting for her.

Behind her, the oak door, the boundary between the curated and the possible, began slowly, silently, to swing shut.

# Chapter 20

## **CHAPTER 20**

The heather was not a carpet. It was a conspiracy. Each sprig, purple-black in the gloaming, hooked at Isla’s ankles with the tenacity of a living question, trying to root her to the spot. The air here was different. It did not have the curated, archival stillness of the Garden, nor the damp, diesel-soaked breath of her Glasgow. It tasted of cold water and crushed green things, of peat-smoke and a profound, listening silence. It was the air of a place that had never been written down.

The woman by the pool did not turn.

Isla moved forward, the thread in her chest a warm, insistent compass needle pointing true. With each step, the sound of her own passage seemed to leach away into the ground, swallowed by the moss and the thick twilight. The door, when she risked a glance back, was a diminishing rectangle of softer dark, a bookmark closing in a story she was no longer reading. She faced forward.

Up close, the pool was a disc of obsidian, holding the bruised sky in a perfect, unrippled grasp. The woman knelt at its edge, her back a curve of worn wool, her hair a long, grey-streaked river down her spine, loosely bound with a strip of leather. Her hands were busy. They moved with a rhythmic, patient certainty over a half-formed shape cradled in her lap. A basket, Isla saw. She was weaving a basket from the dark, sinewy rushes that grew at the water’s margin.

The craft of it was a quiet thunder.

Isla stopped a few paces away, the heather releasing its grip. She could hear the soft, wet *shush* of the rushes as they were drawn through, the minute creak of tension being shaped into purpose. This was not the grand, theatrical craft of the Curator, bending narrative like steel. This was older. It was the craft of making a vessel to hold water, of weaving a boundary to contain something necessary. It was the craft of making a thing to be used.

“You’re here,” the woman said. Her voice was not what Isla had expected. It was not the echo of her own, nor the spectral whisper of a memory. It was low, grainier, textured by wind and use. It was the voice of someone who spoke to the weather.

“I am,” Isla said. The words felt absurdly small, pebbles dropped into the pool’s perfect silence.

The woman’s hands did not cease their work. “You took your time.”

“The path was… complicated.”

A soft, dry sound escaped the woman. Not a laugh. An acknowledgement. “Paths usually are. They’re made by folk who want you to walk them. The moor doesn’t care for paths.” She lifted the nascent basket, turning it slightly, judging its symmetry against the sky. “You carry a thread. I can feel it from here. Pulling at you. A tidy, anxious little stitch.”

Isla’s hand went to her sternum. “It led me to you.”

“It led you to a question,” the woman corrected. She finally set her work aside on the moss and turned.

Her face was a map of a different life. Wind had written lines at the corners of her eyes, which were the same clear, peat-water grey as Isla’s, but set in a network of seams earned by squinting at distant horizons. Her skin was weathered, not old, but *used*, like good leather. There was a quiet ferocity in her bearing, the stillness of a hawk on a branch. This was not a ghost, not a reflection. This was a woman who had built her life from the raw materials of this unwritten place, stone by stone, stitch by stitch.

“You’re her,” Isla breathed. The words were inadequate, but they were all she had. “The one who… didn’t drown.”

The woman—*her mother*, a fact that was not emotional but geological, a mountain suddenly revealed by shifting fog—regarded her with a piercing, appraising look. “I’m the one who chose the deeper water,” she said. “There’s a difference. Drowning is something that happens to you. A choice is something you make.” She gestured to the ground beside her. “Sit. You’re standing like you’re waiting for a bus.”

Isla lowered herself onto the cool, damp moss, the scent of it rising around her. She was acutely aware of her own clothes—the city jeans, the practical boots—next to this woman’s thick skirts and sturdy, handmade shoes. She was a modern annotation in a primal text.

“My name is Isla.”

“I know what you’re called.” Her mother picked up the basket again, her fingers finding their rhythm. “Names are for other people. Out here, you are what you do. The work tells the tale.” She glanced at Isla’s hands. “What’s your work?”

Isla looked at her own palms. One still held the faint, cosmic shimmer of the void she had touched. The other was empty. “I… I was writing a thesis. About spaces between things.”

“Between things,” her mother echoed, the words a neutral tool in her mouth. “And did you find them? These between-places?”

“I found a prison made of them. A garden where stories go to be perfected. I found a man who thinks he’s a concept.” Isla heard the exhaustion, the frayed wonder in her own voice. “I found a door where my grief used to be.”

Her mother nodded, as if Isla had reported on the quality of the rushes. “Grief’s a poor lintel. It cracks under the weight of a real life.” Her eyes flicked to Isla’s face, reading the lines there. “You came looking for a why. Why I left. Why the story ended the way it did for you.”

“Yes.”

“Stories don’t end,” her mother said, her voice flat. “They get abandoned. Or they get curated.” She said the last word like it was a curse, a bitter, foreign thing. “That woman in her tower. She wanted my story. Wanted to press it flat between the pages of her ledger, give it a neat, tragic ending. Drowned woman. Lost mother. A clean, sad punctuation mark.” Her fingers pulled a rush through with a sharp, final tug. “I was a weaver. In your world, I wove cloth. But I was weaving something else, too. A… sensitivity. A thread of my own. I could feel the other looms, the ones working on a different pattern, in a different room. This place.” She gestured to the vast, listening moor with her chin. “It called. Not with words. With a *pull*. Like a stitch dropped in a tapestry, tugging the whole weave out of true.”

She paused, her gaze going distant, seeing not the pool but another shore. “Your father was a good man. But he loved the world he could see. He loved its solidity. Telling him I heard the loom of the moor… it would have been a cruelty. It would have been a story he couldn’t bear to live inside. So I crafted a different ending for him. One he could understand. One that would hurt, but cleanly. A mystery. A loss. An ending.”

The confession was delivered not with tears, but with the grim practicality of a surgeon describing a necessary incision. Isla felt the old, familiar ache—the child’s loss—rise up. But beside it, something new grew: the horrifying, adult understanding of the choice. The craft of it.

“You didn’t drown,” Isla said, the words reshaping the bedrock of her life. “You walked. You just walked into a different story.”

“I followed my thread,” her mother affirmed. “It’s the first rule of craft. You have to be true to the material. I was the material. And my material was pulled taut towards *here*.” She looked at Isla, her gaze softening by a degree. “Leaving you… that was the unweaving. The hardest thing I’ve ever made. Or unmade. I told myself a child needs a solid world. A world with bus routes and school bells and a father who comes home smelling of sawdust and certainty. Not a mother who listens to the spaces between the rain.”

Isla stared into the black mirror of the pool. Her own face, pale and drawn, looked back from its surface, superimposed over the endless sky. “I got the solid world. And I spent my whole life feeling the draft from the door you left open.”

Her mother was silent for a long time, the only sound the whisper of the rushes. “I know,” she said, finally. And in those two words, Isla heard an ocean of unspoken vigil, a mother’s watch from a distant shore. “I felt you feeling it. Every time you stood at a window, restless. Every time you chose the book with the map on the endpaper. The thread you have now… it’s my thread. The one I left behind, anchored in you. I felt it when you picked it up. It’s what finally pulled you through.”

“Finch said I might not be able to go back,” Isla said, the fear tasting metallic. “That this place gets in your blood.”

Her mother gave a short, sharp nod. “He’s a clever ghost. He’s right. This is the source. The unwritten page. The Garden you came from… it’s a museum. A beautiful, terrible museum built downstream from here. This,” she said, lifting her face to the vast, star-pricked twilight now enveloping them, “is the river. You can visit a museum. You can study its displays. But you can’t drink from them.”

“What do I do?” The question was not a child’s plea, but a crafter’s query. *What is the next step in the making?*

Her mother put down the basket. It was finished, a dark, elegant vessel. “You have a choice. You can use that thread,” she said, pointing to Isla’s chest, “as a lifeline. Follow it back through the door, to your Glasgow, to your thesis, to the life that knows how to mourn a drowned woman. It’s a good life. A real one. It has whisky and pubs and the love of a good, solid man, if you’ll let yourself see it.”

Isla thought of Morag’s aubergine hair, the smell of *The Hanged Man*, the weight of a pen in her hand. She thought of Ewan, his quiet, steadfast presence, a bulwark against the strange drafts of her mind.

“Or?” Isla asked.

“Or,” her mother said, and her voice changed, deepening with a note of fierce, wild pride, “you can take up the shuttle. You can learn the weave of this place. Not to curate it. To *inhabit* it. Your thread isn’t just a connection to me. It’s a connection to the loom itself. You have a craft in you, Isla. A different one from mine. You don’t just feel the between-places. You *map* them. You give them names. In that tower, you didn’t just break a rule. You wrote a new one. You turned a prison into a possibility.”

She reached out, not to touch Isla, but to the space between them. Her work-roughened fingers traced a shape in the air, and for a moment, Isla saw it: a faint, shimmering schematic, a bridge of light and intuition, spanning the gap between their two worlds. It was the ghost of her thesis, made manifest not in ink, but in pure potential.

“The Curator fears you,” her mother said, letting the vision fade. “Not because you’re powerful. But because you’re *generative*. You don’t want to perfect a story. You want to start a new one. That’s the one thing her Garden cannot hold.”

High above, in the tower that was and was not there, the Curator watched. The single, living tear in her palm had dried, leaving a faint, salt-crystal sentence on her skin. She saw the two women by the primordial pool, not as a concluded tragedy, but as a binary star system, their combined gravity warping the narrative space around them. She saw the door to the Garden, now almost closed. And she saw something else.

A ripple.

It began at the pool’s edge where Isla sat. A single, concentric ring moving out across the obsidian surface, untouched by wind. It was a pulse of pure, unchanneled potential. Isla’s potential. It was the first tremor of a story deciding to be born.

The Curator’s breath hitched. This was not a thread to be clipped. It was a root, pushing through the foundation of her perfect world. She could feel it in the ledger in her hands. The page for *Isla MacLeod* was no longer accepting ink. The words were shifting, rearranging themselves into something new. A title was forming at the top of a fresh, blank page beneath.

She had wanted an ending. She was getting a prologue.

Down on the moor, Isla felt the ripple move through her. It was the echo of her own choice, reflected back by the source. She looked from her mother’s fierce, expectant face to the dark doorway shrinking in the distance. She thought of the gendered cartography of her thesis, of how she had always mapped the spaces women were forced into, or vanished from. Here was a space a woman had carved for herself. A space beyond the map.

“If I stay,” Isla said, her voice finding a new solidity, “it’s not to be your daughter. Not in the way that word means back there.”

Her mother’s smile was a swift, bright thing, like a knife catching the light. “Good. Here, I am Elspeth. You are Isla. We are weavers at the same loom. That is a harder, truer thing.”

“And the Garden? The Curator?”

Elspeth’s face hardened. “She is a weaver too. But she weaves shrouds. Beautiful, perfect shrouds. She will see your choice as a threat. She will try to mend the tear you’ve made, to force your story back into its assigned shape.” She picked up the newly finished basket and handed it to Isla. It was cool, surprisingly light, and stronger than it looked. “Your first lesson. To make a thing is to define a space. To define a space is to create a world. She deals in endings. You must learn to deal in beginnings. Even small ones.”

Isla took the basket. It felt right in her hands. A vessel. For what, she did not yet know.

“How?” she asked.

Elspeth stood, brushing moss from her skirts. “You start by walking the unwritten moor. You listen. You feel the pull of the threads that are not yours. And when you find a story that’s been trapped, a song that’s been silenced, a door that’s been sealed shut…” She looked at Isla, her peat-grey eyes holding the last of the light. “You use your craft. Not to give it an ending. To give it a *next*.”

The hook in Isla’s chest was no longer a pull. It was a hum. A tuning fork struck against the bone of the world. She looked back one last time. The oak door was a thin, vertical line of not-quite-darkness. Then, with a finality that was neither a slam nor a whisper, but simply the sound of a page turning, it was gone.

She was not in the Garden. She was not in Glasgow.

She was in the source.

Above, the stars were coming out, not as distant pinpricks, but as close, watchful eyes. They were not the stars of any constellation she knew. They were the first words of a language she would have to learn.

Elspeth was already moving, a silhouette against the starry vastness, heading away from the pool towards a low, steady glow on the horizon—a light that promised hearth, not archive; a home, not a museum.

Isla MacLeod stood, the woven basket in her hand. She took a deep breath of the raw, uncurated air. Then she followed.

Behind them, in the now-sealed Garden, the Curator stared at the new page in her ledger. The title had finished writing itself. It glistened, wet and dark, as if inscribed not in ink, but in the water of a primordial pool.

It read: *The Weavers at the Loom of the Moor*.

And beneath it, the page was not blank. It was a mirror. Reflecting back at her was not her own masked face, but Isla’s—determined, unafraid, and walking into a story with no end in sight.

The Curator closed the book with a sound like a verdict. She walked to her window that was not there and looked out at her perfect, dying world. The symmetry was beginning to fray at the edges. A wind was rising—a damp, heather-scented wind from a place she could not control.

She had a choice now, too. She could fight to mend the fraying. To find Isla MacLeod and force her, and the chaos she represented, back into a manageable, tragic shape.

Or she could do the one thing her perfect system feared most.

She could pick up a pen, not to record, but to invent. She could write her own next.

Her hand, the one that had caught the living tear, trembled. It moved towards a drawer in her desk of polished despair, a drawer that had been locked since the first story was filed away. Inside was not a ledger, but a single, blank, unbound sheet of paper.

The hook for the next chapter was not in the moor, nor in the tower. It was in the terrifying, exquisite tremor in the Curator’s wrist, hovering between the prison of the perfect ending and the abyss of an authentic beginning.

# Chapter 21

## **CHAPTER 21**

The light on the horizon was not a single point, but a constellation of low, golden embers scattered across the moor’s dark breast. As Isla followed Elspeth’s sure-footed silhouette, the embers resolved into the lit windows of crofts, their panes holding the glow like captured pieces of a kinder sun. The air was a tonic of peat-smoke, damp earth, and the sweet, decaying perfume of bracken. It was the smell of a world that was used, not preserved; lived-in, not curated.

Elspeth led her to the largest of the crofts, a long, low building of stone and sagging thatch from which a plume of smoke rose in a confident grey column against the star-flecked sky. No path led to its door. The ground was simply worn bare by the passage of feet that knew where they were going without being told.

“Welcome,” Elspeth said, her voice softened by the moor’s vast quiet, “to the Spindle.”

Inside, the air was thick with warmth and the scent of stewing herbs, wool, and woodsmoke. A fire roared in a hearth wide enough to park a car in, its light dancing over a dozen faces that turned towards the door. They were all women, their ages a topography from smooth youth to weathered antiquity. They sat in various states of work: some carding raw, oily wool, their hands moving with a rhythmic, pulling grace; others spun thread onto spindles that whirled like captive planets; a few worked at a vast, wooden loom that took up one entire wall, its warp threads taut as the strings of a colossal, horizontal harp. The shuttle, passed hand to hand, was a polished bone the length of a forearm.

The conversation, a low hum of Gaelic and laughter, did not stop. It merely absorbed them, as the moor had absorbed their footsteps.

A woman near the fire, her hair a wild corona of silver and her face a network of lines as deep and meaningful as runes, looked up from her spinning. Her eyes, the colour of flint, found Isla’s. They held no surprise, only a profound, assessing calm.

“So,” the woman said, her voice the sound of stone grinding against stone, yet not unkind. “The one who walked out of a story. Bring her to the fire, Elspeth. Let’s see what the Garden tried to make of her.”

Isla moved forward, the woven basket still in her hand. The eyes of the weavers tracked her, not with hostility, but with the focused attention of cartographers surveying a new, uncertain coastline. She felt herself being read—the set of her shoulders, the Glasgow pallor beneath the moor’s wind-flush, the way her fingers tightened on the basket’s handle as if it were a lifeline thrown from a sinking ship.

“Sit,” the silver-haired woman commanded, nodding to a three-legged stool near the hearth. “I am Mairi. This,” she gestured with her chin to encompass the room, the looms, the women, “is what we do. We don’t archive. We don’t curate. We *weave*.”

Isla sat, the heat of the fire pressing against her skin like a firm hand. “Weave what?”

Mairi’s spindle never ceased its hypnotic whirl. “The frayed ends. The discarded threads. The stories that don’t fit into their neat little books. The Garden takes a life, pins it like a butterfly, gives it a label and a tragic symmetry. We find the thread that was cut too soon, the colour that was deemed unsuitable, the pattern that was too wild. And we weave it back in.”

“Back into what?”

“Into *this*,” Mairi said, her flint eyes glinting. “Into the cloth of what’s real. The Garden’s world is a pressed flower. Beautiful, dead. Ours is a living blanket. It has holes. It’s lumpy. It smells of sheep and sweat and supper. But it is warm. And it can grow.”

One of the younger weavers, a girl with fierce red hair and forearms corded with muscle from working the loom, spoke without looking up from her knots. “She’s got the look of a trimmed thread about her. Neatly cut. You can see the shears’ mark.”

Isla thought of her thesis, her life in Glasgow, the prescribed trajectory of academic grief. She thought of the letter on pressed-bone paper. “I was being trimmed for a tragedy,” she said, the words coming out with more bitterness than she intended. “A cautionary tale about reaching too high.”

Mairi nodded, a slow, grave dip of her head. “Aye. The ‘Scholar Destroyed By Her Own Curiosity.’ A classic. A tidy ending. But you…” She leaned forward, and the firelight carved the valleys of her face into deeper shadow. “You did not end. You *unravelled*. And you came here, trailing threads. Show us what you brought from that place.”

Isla looked down at the basket. She had almost forgotten its weight. Carefully, she lifted the cloth and revealed the contents. The peat-bog ghost, now just a bottle of unremarkable whisky. The cream-coloured letter. The photograph of her grandmother. The small, smooth stone from the river. The torn page from the Curator’s ledger.

A silence fell, deeper than before. The hum of work ceased. The only sounds were the crackle of the fire and the mournful sigh of the wind against the thatch.

Mairi set her spindle down. She reached out, not for the ledger page, but for the stone. She held it in her palm, her thumb stroking its surface. “An anchor,” she murmured. “Good.” She picked up the photograph, her eyes softening for a fraction of a second. “A face to guide the pattern. Also good.” The letter she barely glanced at. “A map drawn by a man who never left his study. Useful only to know the traps.”

Finally, she took the torn ledger page. She did not read the words *The Weavers at the Loom of the Moor*. She turned it over, ran a calloused finger along the ragged edge where it had been torn from the book. “This,” she said, her voice dropping to a whisper that the whole room leaned in to catch, “is a wound. In her world, and now in ours. A door she did not mean to open. It is the most powerful thing here.”

She looked at Isla, and her gaze was no longer merely assessing. It was an invitation. A challenge. “You have the raw stuff. The cut threads. But to weave, you must learn the craft. You must choose your own pattern. Or would you prefer we do it for you? We could make you a warm, simple shawl of forgetting. You could live out your days here by the fire, and the story of Isla MacLeod would be a pleasant, minor pattern in the corner of the blanket. A happy footnote.”

The offer hung in the smoky air, seductive in its simplicity. Isla looked around the room. She saw the contentment in the weavers’ faces, the purpose in their hands. It was a good life. A sane life. It was everything the sterile horror of the Garden was not.

But it was also a life where her story would be subsumed, its particular ache blended into the communal wool. She thought of the Curator’s ledger, of her own face reflected back as a finished title. She thought of her grandmother’s stories, told not to be filed away, but to be lived into.

“No,” Isla said, and her voice did not tremble. “I don’t want a shawl. I want to learn the loom.”

A slow smile spread across Mairi’s face, a crack in stone that revealed a deep, warm strata beneath. “I thought you might.” She stood, her bones creaking like the timbers of an old ship. “Then your first lesson is this: the Garden’s power is in endings. Our power is in the *join*. The place where one thread meets another. Where your story meets mine, meets hers.” She gestured to the women around them. “Where grief meets anger, where memory meets hope. The join is never seamless. It is a knot. A bump. A change in texture. That is where the strength lies. That is where the truth is.”

She led Isla to the great loom. Up close, it was a beast of polished dark wood and tension. The warp threads were not one colour, but a thousand—the grey of a Glasgow sky, the green of hospital walls, the russet of heather, the gold of whisky, the stark white of bone-paper, the deep black of a curator’s robe.

“Your life,” Mairi said, placing a hand on the frame. “Your threads. Already strung. You’ve been strung on this loom since the day you were born. The Garden tried to weave you into a shroud. We will help you weave yourself into something else. But *you* must throw the shuttle. You must choose the weft.”

She handed Isla the bone shuttle. It was warm, heavier than it looked, and fitted to her grip as if it had been waiting for her.

“What is the weft?” Isla asked, her throat tight.

“Your choices. Your actions. What you do next. Every pass of the shuttle is a decision. It crosses the threads of your past, your nature, your circumstances. It binds them into a fabric. Now,” Mairi stepped back, her flint eyes gleaming. “You have a wound in your hand. A torn page. What is your first pass? What is the first choice you weave across the threads of your life?”

Isla looked at the shuttle. She looked at the loom, at the myriad threads of her own history, taut and waiting. She thought of the Curator, alone in her tower, her hand trembling over a blank page. Two women, separated by the abyss between a prison and a moor, both holding the terrible, exquisite weight of a next.

She took a deep breath, the air rich with smoke and wool and possibility.

She threw the shuttle.

It was not graceful. It clattered against the warp threads, and the resulting line of weft—a thick, homespun yarn the colour of raw peat—was uneven, bumpy. But it was *there*. A tangible, physical fact. A join made.

A soft murmur of approval rippled through the weavers. Elspeth, watching from near the door, gave a single, firm nod.

“Good,” Mairi grunted. “A strong, ugly, honest choice. Now. Do it again.”

*

In the tower that was not a tower, in the room with a window that was not there, the Curator sat at her desk of polished despair. The drawer was open.

Before her lay the single, blank, unbound sheet of paper. Its emptiness was a void more terrifying than any of the tragic, completed stories in her ledgers. Those had rules. Symmetry. A predictable, beautiful despair. This had… potential. It was an abyss of *could be*.

Her hand, the one that had caught the tear, still trembled. The tremor was a tiny rebellion in her perfectly ordered system, a seismic event in the stilled world of her body. She tried to still it by force of will, the way she stilled unruly narratives. The tremor deepened.

She looked at her other hand, resting flat and calm on the ledger titled *The Weavers at the Loom of the Moor*. The ink of the title was dry now, but the page beneath was still a mirror. It no longer showed Isla’s face. It showed the interior of the croft. The fire. The loom. Isla’s clumsy, determined first pass with the shuttle.

The Curator watched. She saw the women gather around, not to criticise, but to support. She saw a young weaver with red hair lean in and adjust Isla’s grip on the shuttle, her touch practical and kind. She saw Mairi point to a thread of Glasgow-grey in the warp and say something that made Isla nod, a look of dawning understanding on her face.

It was collaboration. It was mess. It was a process, not a product.

A sensation, alien and sharp, pierced the Curator’s chest. It was not the familiar, comfortable ache of tragic beauty. It was hotter. Rawer. It felt like watching a favourite, precious specimen—a rare, doomed butterfly—not only escape its pin, but melt its glass case, fly to a muddy field, and start pollinating weeds.

It was fury.

Pure, undiluted, magnificent fury.

The tremor in her hand stopped. It was replaced by a steady, terrifying certainty. She would not mend the fraying edges of her symmetry. She would not write herself a meek, introspective next on this blank page.

She would *burn* the moor.

She would take her pen, the instrument of perfect endings, and she would use it to write an ending so absolute, so aesthetically devastating, that it would swallow the Spindle, the weavers, and the upstart thread of Isla MacLeod forever. She would write a storm. A plague. A forgetting so profound it would unravel their clumsy cloth from the inside out.

She reached for her pen, a sleek, black instrument that had never known an uncertain line.

But as her fingers closed around it, the mirror-page in the ledger shimmered. Isla, at the loom, had just completed another pass. This one was smoother. The weft yarn was a different colour—a hesitant, but unmistakable, strand of gold, like the first weak sunlight after a long night. As it locked into place, crossing the thread of the torn ledger page, the Curator felt a corresponding, faint *pull* in her own wrist.

She looked down. A single, fine, almost invisible filament of gold had appeared on her blank sheet of paper. It was not ink. It was thread. It stretched from the tip of her pen, across the void of the page, and disappeared into the air, taut with connection.

Isla’s choice. Her action. Her weft. It was not contained in the Garden. It was reaching back. Weaving into the Curator’s story.

The Curator’s fury crystallised into something colder, more brilliant. This was no longer a simple extermination. This was a duel. A narrative duel across the interstitial reality. She was no longer just a curator fighting chaos. She was an author, challenged by another.

A slow, thin smile touched her lips, the first genuine expression her face had held in centuries. It was not a pleasant sight.

“Very well, Isla MacLeod,” she whispered to the empty, perfect air. “You wish to weave? Then let us weave. Let us see whose pattern can hold. Let us see who gets to write the ending of the other.”

She did not move to cut the golden thread. Instead, she placed her pen against the blank page, at a right angle to the invading filament. She would not write *around* Isla’s thread. She would write *against* it. She would use Isla’s own choices as a new warp in her own design, and weave them into a masterpiece of despair so exquisite it would make the tragedy she’d originally planned for Isla look like a child’s scribble.

She began to write. Her script, usually so flawless, was deliberate, heavy, each word a bar of iron designed to weight down the hopeful gold. She wrote of a wind, not damp and heather-scented, but sharp and glassy, carrying a frost that killed not plants, but memory. She wrote of a flaw in the wool, a blight that started at the join and rotted the cloth from within. She wrote of a weaver’s betrayal, a pattern of suspicion and pride that would unravel their community from the inside.

Each sentence she wrote manifested on the page not as ink, but as a thread—dark, glittering, and cold. They crossed Isla’s single golden filament, binding it, seeking to choke its light. The blank page was no longer blank. It was becoming the battleground.

And in the Spindle, Isla felt a sudden chill, a dissonance in the rhythm of the loom. The warp thread that was the torn ledger page grew taut, then slack, then taut again, as if something were pulling on it from a great distance. The golden weft she had just woven seemed to dim for a heartbeat.

She looked up from the loom, her hands stilling. Mairi was watching her, the old weaver’s face grim.

“She’s answering,” Mairi said, her voice low. “The Gardener. She’s taken your first pass, and she’s making her counter-move. This is the work now. Not just weaving your life. But defending the weave.”

Isla looked at the bone shuttle in her hand, then at the complex, beautiful, fragile tapestry of threads before her. She was no longer just learning a craft. She was at war. A war fought not with weapons, but with choices. Every pass of her shuttle would be a parry. Every colour she chose would be a defiance.

She took a new thread from a basket by the loom. This one was not gold, but a deep, resilient blue, the colour of a deep loch under a winter sky—the colour of endurance. She fitted it into the shuttle.

She threw it.

The thread flew true, crossing the darkened warp, reinforcing the gold, adding a new strength to the pattern.

In her tower, the Curator felt the resistance. She saw a new blue thread appear on her page, strengthening the gold, complicating her dark design. Her smile did not waver. It deepened. She dipped her pen into a well of a darker ink, and wrote of a flood.

*

The hook for the next chapter was not in the chill of the rising glassy wind, nor in the growing warmth of the croft’s fire. It was in the silent, relentless dialogue between two looms. One of wood and wool and living hands, warmed by a hearth. One of paper and ink and desperate will, in a tower of perfect cold. Each pass of a shuttle, each stroke of a pen, was a move in a game where the stakes were the very shape of a soul. The cloth on the loom in the Spindle was growing, a patchwork of peat-brown, gold, and loch-blue, its joins bumpy and strong. The pattern on the Curator’s page was a dark, glittering counterpoint, a thing of terrible, invasive beauty. They were weaving each other now. And the next thread to be chosen—whether by a woman finding her strength in the smell of wool and smoke, or by a woman discovering a terrifying new power in the taste of her own fury—would determine whose reality would finally hold the warp.

# Chapter 22

## **CHAPTER 22**

The loom was a fortress. The loom was a battleground. Isla MacLeod’s hands, chapped from lye soap and raw wool, moved with a rhythm that was no longer just craft. It was cadence. The deep loch-blue thread, the colour of endurance, had become the weft of her defence, a steady, stubborn beat against the invasive dark. Each pass of the bone shuttle was a breath held, a prayer muttered, a door barred. The cloth growing on the frame was a testament not to beauty, but to resilience; its joins were lumpy, its texture uneven, a topography of stubborn survival.

In the tower, the Curator’s pen was a scalpel. She had written of a flood, and in the Spindle, the glassy wind had howled for three days, bringing a cold rain that seeped through the thickest stone. Isla and Morag had moved the loom away from the window, where the wind shrieked like a thing in pain. The peat fire spat and hissed at the damp. But Isla had woven. She had taken a thread the colour of banked peat-embers, a dull, stubborn red, and woven it alongside the blue. *Warmth against the damp*, she thought. *A hearth against the flood*. The pattern absorbed it, the cloth thickened.

Now, the Curator observed the new, fiery strand in her page’s counter-pattern. It was a vulgar colour, a peasant colour. It offended the pristine, glittering darkness of her design. She felt not anger, but a cool, surgical curiosity. The girl was not just resisting; she was innovating. Building. The Curator dipped her pen. She did not write of a new catastrophe. Instead, she wrote of a gift.

*

The gift arrived with the tinker.

He appeared at the croft door as the unnatural rain finally ceased, leaving a world washed in a thin, silvered light that felt borrowed from a dream. He was a lean man, all tendons and sharp angles, his face hidden beneath the broad brim of a hat that dripped onto the threshold. His pack, slung over one shoulder, clinked with a sound like distant chimes.

“A fine, damp day for it,” he said, his voice a dry rustle. “I’ve wares. Needles that never dull. Pots that sing when the water boils. Thread.”

Isla, her back aching from the loom, watched him from the hearth. Morag stood in the doorway, a silhouette against the grey light, her arms crossed. The pirate queen assessing a potential boarder.

“We’ve thread enough,” Morag said, her tone flat as slate.

“Aye, the kind that comes from sheep,” the tinker said, a smile in his voice. “Good, honest stuff. I speak of another kind. Found thread. Lost thread.” His head tilted, and his gaze found Isla over Morag’s shoulder. It was a needle-prick of attention. “A colour you’re missing.”

Isla felt it then—a pull, a yearning deep in the marrow of her craft. The loom’s warp seemed to hum, a faint vibration in the quiet croft. She knew, with a certainty that tasted of cold iron, that this was the Curator’s move. Not an assault, but an offering. A poisoned gift.

“Let him in,” Isla said, her own voice surprising her with its steadiness.

Morag shot her a look that was pure, undiluted warning, but stepped aside. The tinker entered, bringing the smell of wet wool and ozone with him. He shrugged off his pack, the clinking subsiding, and from a worn leather pouch, he drew a single skein.

It was a thread of impossible silver. Not the grey of a Glasgow sky, but the liquid, living silver of a moonpath on a still sea. It seemed to hold the light in the dim croft, not reflecting it, but drinking it, and glowing with a soft, internal radiance. It was the most beautiful thing Isla had ever seen. Her fingers itched for it. The loom *sang* for it. This silver would bridge the peat-brown and the loch-blue, it would highlight the ember-red. It would make the cloth not just strong, but glorious.

“Where did you find that?” Morag asked, her voice dangerously quiet.

“Oh, it finds its own way,” the tinker said, laying the skein on the rough table. It seemed out of place, a jewel on a bed of burlap. “Tumbled from a lady’s sewing basket in a coach long lost. Waited in a ditch for a century. It wants to be used. It’s *lonely*.”

The word hung in the air. Isla understood loneliness as a physical space, a room in the heart with a locked door. This thread, this beautiful, stolen silver, was an embodiment of that ache. The Curator hadn’t sent a weapon. She had sent a mirror. A reflection of Isla’s own deepest solitude, polished into irresistible allure.

“It’s a trap,” Morag stated, not a question.

“Everything’s a trap, hen,” the tinker chuckled, tapping the side of his nose. “The question is, can you spring it and take the cheese? The lady who… misplaced this… she believes you’ll see the trap and refuse. That your fear will starve your work. That you’ll weave only in safe, dull colours.” He pushed the skein an inch closer to Isla. “But a weaver who fears a beautiful thread is no weaver at all. She’s a seamstress.”

It was the perfect provocation. It cut to the core of Isla’s academic pride, her artistic yearning, her very identity. To refuse was to admit fear, to be small. To accept was to play the Curator’s game on her terms. Isla looked from the silver to her loom, to the strong, humble, uneven cloth upon it. It was honest. It was hers. This silver was a stranger’s voice, beautiful and full of lies.

She walked to the table. She did not pick up the skein. She leaned close, looking at the twist of the filaments. There, almost invisible, was a faint, dark core running through the centre of each strand, like a vein of ink through a precious stone.

“It’s tainted,” Isla said.

“All beauty is, in some light,” the tinker shrugged. “It’s still beauty.”

Isla straightened. The yearning was still there, a hook in her heart. But she saw the hook now. “Take it back to her. Tell her I don’t work with stolen materials. I spin my own.”

For a moment, the tinker’s affable mask slipped. His eyes, in the shadow of his hat, were not a tinker’s eyes. They were old, and empty, and patient. Then the smile returned. “As you wish. A pity. It would have sung on your loom.” He swept the silver back into his pouch, the light in the croft dimming perceptibly. With a nod, he was gone, back into the silvered damp.

Morag let out a long breath. “Well done, girl.”

Isla didn’t feel like she’d done well. She felt scraped-out, hollow. She had won the point but felt the cost. The rejection of that beauty was a little death. She returned to the loom, to her honest, ugly, strong threads. The rhythm felt heavier now.

In the tower, the Curator received the report from her empty-eyed servant. She was not disappointed. She had expected refusal. The first offer was always refused by the righteous. It was the second, third, fourth offer that eroded principle. The gift had been placed. The seed of desire had been planted. Now, she would let it grow in the dark soil of Isla’s deprivation. She wrote, not of a new threat, but of a deepening silence. A loneliness so profound it would make the memory of that silver thread ache like a phantom limb.

*

The silence in the Spindle became a physical presence. The wind died. The rain stopped. Even the crackle of the fire seemed muted, swallowed by a thick, woolly quiet. It was the silence of a held breath, of a vacuum. Isla wove, but the *clack* of the beater sounded solitary, pathetic, a tiny noise in an immense, listening stillness. The colours of her cloth—brown, blue, red—seemed to dull, as if starved of contrast. The lack of the silver was an ache. She began to dream of it, a shimmering path leading away from the loom, away from the croft, into a landscape of cool, perfect light.

“She’s isolating you,” Morag said, her voice too loud in the quiet. She was carding wool, the rhythmic *scritch-scratch* a feeble defiance. “It’s what they do. Cut you off from sound, from sense, until your own mind is the only voice, and it starts to whisper their arguments for them.”

“I’m not listening,” Isla muttered, throwing the shuttle. It felt leaden.

“You don’t listen with your ears in this place,” Morag said. “You listen with your gut. And your gut is hungry for that pretty poison.”

Isla said nothing. Morag’s words were another thread of plain, ugly truth. She wove it in, a strand of gritty grey, the colour of Morag’s hair before the aubergine dye, the colour of Glasgow pavement. *Truth against silence*.

Days bled into each other, marked only by the growing panel of cloth and the deepening quiet. Isla found herself talking to the loom, to the threads, just to hear a voice. She told them about Glasgow, about the peat-ghost whisky, about Professor Finch’s letter that felt like pressed bone. The loom absorbed her stories, the cloth becoming a ledger of her past.

Then, the second gift came.

It did not arrive with a tinker. It simply *was*. Isla woke at dawn, the terrible silence already pressing down on the croft, and went to draw water from the rain-barrel. There, floating on the still, dark surface, was a single, perfect pearl. It glowed with the same inner luminescence as the silver thread. It was not attached to anything. It was just a pearl, an offering on the altar of her need.

She stared at it. It was a condensed tear. It was a moon. It was a trap. Her hand trembled over the water. She could take it. She could pierce it, string it, weave it into the cloth as a single, stunning accent. One pearl. What harm could one pearl do?

*It’s not the pearl*, a voice in her said—her own voice, shaped by Morag’s grit. *It’s the acceptance. It’s the crack in the door.*

With a cry that was swallowed by the silence, she brought her cupped hands down, not to retrieve the pearl, but to sink it. She stirred the water violently until the pearl swirled away into the depths of the barrel. When the water stilled, it was gone. Her heart hammered. She had refused again. But the effort felt Herculean. The pearl’s image was seared behind her eyes.

The Curator, sensing the violent rejection, smiled with genuine pleasure. The struggle was exquisite. The girl was strong. Breaking her would be a masterpiece. She wrote of a memory. A specific memory: the smell of a particular perfume—*Fleurs du Mal*—on a university corridor. The memory of a betrayal not by a lover, but by a mentor. A small, academic cruelty that had festered. She gave the memory weight, texture, and sent it drifting into the Spindle like a leaf on a still pond.

*

Isla was weaving a section of peat-brown, trying to anchor herself in the solid, earthy colour, when the memory struck. It was not a thought. It was an ambush.

The smell of *Fleurs du Mal*—cloying, expensive, out of place in the dusty philosophy department—filled her nostrils. She saw Professor Callahan, her doctoral supervisor, laughing with a visiting professor from Oxford, a man with teeth like a polished graveyard. “Isla’s work is *charmingly* parochial,” Callahan had said, not knowing she was around the corner. “A feminist rereading of the liminal? It’s a thesis, certainly. But groundbreaking? One must have a broader palette.” The Oxford man had chuckled, a dry, rustling sound. The smell of the perfume had mixed with the smell of their contempt.

Isla gasped, the shuttle falling from her hand. The memory was a knife, twisted in an old, half-forgotten wound. It was also utterly, devastatingly true. It had happened. This was not an invented horror. It was her own past, weaponised.

“What is it?” Morag was at her side in an instant.

“She’s… using my own memories,” Isla choked out, the peat-brown blurring before her eyes. “Not just offering pretty things. She’s using what’s already inside me.”

Morag’s face hardened. “Aye. That’s the final garrison. When the enemy is already within the walls. You can refuse a gift, hen. How do you refuse a truth?”

Isla had no answer. The silence of the Spindle was now filled with the echo of that laughter, that perfume. She felt exposed, flayed. The Curator wasn’t just weaving a counter-pattern; she was unweaving Isla’s own. Picking out the threads of her confidence, her intellect, her very history, and showing her how thin they were.

Trembling, Isla picked up the shuttle. She could not weave the peat-brown. It felt like the mud of that humiliation. She reached for a new colour, her hand moving past the blues and reds. She found a spool of a sickly, jaundiced yellow—the colour of old paper, of academic envy, of a coward’s smile. She threaded it.

“What are you doing?” Morag asked, her voice tight.

“Using it,” Isla said, her voice raw. “If she wants to give me my past, I’ll weave it in. But I’ll frame it. I’ll surround it.”

With a fury that was close to despair, she began to weave with the jaundiced yellow. It made a foul, vibrant stripe across the cloth. But around it, she wove a fierce, protective border of the ember-red—the colour of her anger—and the gritty grey of Morag’s truth. She did not hide the yellow. She showcased it. She made it a prisoner in her own tapestry.

In the tower, the Curator felt the shift. The memory-thread had been accepted, but not as a flaw. It had been incorporated as a deliberate motif. The girl was learning the deepest lesson: not to reject the dark threads, but to subjugate them. To make them part of the pattern’s strength. A flicker of something that was not fury, but profound annoyance, passed through the Curator’s perfect composure. This was no longer a game of seduction. It was a duel of interpretations.

She set down her pen. She would not write another memory. Instead, she would write a connection. A bridge. She would use the one thread Isla could not resist, the one memory that was not a weapon but a lifeline. She began to write of a smell of peat and old books. Of a voice, dry as parchment, speaking of unseen bridges. She wrote of Professor Alistair Finch.

*

The third gift was a sound.

The silence broke not with a crash, but with a whisper. It was the faint, rhythmic scratch of a pen on paper. Isla, dozing by the hearth, jerked awake. Morag was already standing, a carding comb held like a weapon.

The sound came from outside the croft door. Not threatening. Insistent. Familiar.

Isla knew that sound. She had sat outside Professor Finch’s office for hours, listening to it through the oak door, a metronome marking the passage of academic wisdom. Her heart, a trapped bird, beat against her ribs. This was the cruelest gambit yet. The silver was desire. The pearl was temptation. The memory was a wound. But Finch… Finch was hope. He was the reason she was here. He was the architect of the unseen bridge she was trying to cross.

She walked to the door, Morag’s warning hiss a distant thing.

“Don’t you open that, Isla MacLeod. It’s not him. It’s a *ventriloquist’s trick*.”

Isla knew it wasn’t him. But it was *of* him. A perfect echo. A concept given sound. She laid her palm against the rough wood. The scratching stopped. Then, his voice, old and dry and kind, exactly as she remembered it from their one meeting in *The Hanged Man*, seeped through the crack.

“Isla?” it said. “The bridge… it’s not in the weaving alone. It’s in the joining of disparate threads. You must use *all* the threads, my dear. Even the borrowed ones. Especially the borrowed ones. A bridge, by its nature, is made of foreign material.”

It was him. It was the essence of his thesis. It was also the perfect, logical argument for accepting the Curator’s gifts. It was the intellectual seduction to complement the aesthetic one. Her mind, trained to follow his logic, leapt to agree. *Of course*. A bridge was connection. It required material from both shores. To refuse the foreign thread was to refuse the bridge itself.

Tears of sheer cognitive conflict pricked her eyes. This was the checkmate. How could she refuse her own purpose?

Morag was beside her, not touching her, a solid presence in the gloom. “He’s a concept, hen,” she whispered, echoing her own words from a lifetime ago in a Glasgow pub. “And concepts can be forged. She’s forged yours.”

Isla leaned her forehead against the door. The urge to open it, to see the ghost of the old professor standing there with his kind eyes and his devastating logic, was a physical pain. It would be so easy. It would make so much *sense*.

She thought of the cloth on the loom. Its bumpy, honest joins. Its defensive, defiant colours. It was not a graceful bridge. It was a barricade. It was a home. And a home could be made only from what you owned, what you’d grown, what you’d fought for. You didn’t build a home from borrowed, beautiful, poisoned stones.

She found her voice. It was a thread, thin but strong. “A bridge is a crossing,” she said to the door, to the ghost, to the Curator listening beyond. “A home is a destination. I’m not building a bridge anymore, Professor. I’m building a home. And I’ll build it with my own hands.”

The silence returned. But it was different now. It was no longer a suffocating vacuum. It was a silence she had earned. The scratching did not come again.

Back at the loom, her hands were steady. She did not reach for a new, dramatic colour. She took up the humble peat-brown once more. But now, she wove it with a new understanding. It wasn’t just dirt. It was foundation. She wove the memory of Callahan’s betrayal into it, not as a separate stripe, but as a dark fleck within the brown, a stone in the foundation. She wove the yearning for the silver as a faint, almost invisible gloss on the loch-blue. She wove the ghost of Finch’s voice into the twist of the ember-red and the gritty grey.

She was not just defending her weave. She was digesting the assault. Making the attacks part of the structure’s strength. The cloth grew, more complex, more integrated, more *real*.

In her tower, the Curator watched the new pattern emerge on her page. The dark, glittering counterpoint was still there, but it was no longer simply opposed to Isla’s work. It was being… metabolised. The girl’s tapestry was becoming a palimpsest, with the Curator’s own dark ink showing through as a layer of history, not as an overriding text. For the first time, a cold trickle of something akin to fear touched the Curator’s spine. She was not losing. But she was no longer the sole author. She was in a dialogue with a will that was learning to write back.

She looked at her page, at the beautiful, terrible story she had composed. Then she looked at the final, untouched well of ink on her desk. It was not black, but a colourless, viscous fluid that reflected nothing. It was the ink of erasure. Of unwriting. The ultimate counter-move. To not add a dark thread, but to dissolve a light one. To not attack the weaver, but to vanish a fundamental thread from her warp.

A slow, frigid smile touched her lips. The duel of interpretations was over. It was time to change the nature of the game. She dipped her pen into the colourless well. She would not write a new sentence. She would carefully, precisely, blot one out.

*

The hook for the next chapter was not in the profound silence that now felt like peace, nor in the solid, growing weight of the cloth on the loom. It was in the empty space on the Curator’s page where a word used to be. It was in the sudden, inexplicable gap in Isla’s memory as she wove—a gap where the smell of her mother’s hair, the specific scent of heather and lanolin that was the very first thread of her being, had simply ceased to exist. The battle for the tapestry had reached a stalemate of strength. Now, the war would move to a more terrifying frontier: the war for what had always been true. The Curator had stopped trying to add to the story. She had begun, with meticulous care, to subtract.

# Chapter 23

## **CHAPTER 23**

The cloth on the loom was a continent. It had weight, a geography of ridges and valleys formed by the tight-packed weft, a climate held in the humidity of the wool. Isla’s hands moved across it, not as a weaver’s tools, but as a surveyor’s instruments, taking a bearing on a landscape she was still learning to name. The profound silence that had followed the integration of the Curator’s dark thread was not empty. It was dense, like the air before a thunderstorm that never breaks. It was the silence of a held breath.

She was weaving a border now, a complex braid of ochre and slate grey, a representation of the old drystone dyke that had separated her father’s croft from the moor. It was a memory of boundaries, of the deliberate, patient act of division. As her shuttle passed through the shed, she reached for the sensory truth of it—the gritty chill of the granite, the slickness of the moss on the north-facing stones, the way the wind would whistle a different note through each gap.

But the memory was silent.

She paused, the shuttle resting in her palm like a dormant bird. She closed her eyes, pushing past the image of the dyke to the day she was remembering. She had been seven, maybe eight. She’d scraped her knee on a stone, a bright, stinging bloom of pain. Her mother had lifted her onto the warm capstone of the dyke, had spat—a quick, pragmatic gesture—onto the corner of her apron, and had wiped the dirt from the wound. Isla had howled, more from the indignity than the hurt.

“Hush now, *mo chridhe*,” her mother had said, her voice a low, warm drone against Isla’s temple. “It’s just the land reminding you it’s there. It leaves its mark so you don’t forget.”

Then she had leaned in, her breath smelling of strong tea and the morning’s porridge, and kissed the crown of Isla’s head. And in that kiss, there had been a scent. A specific, foundational perfume that was the bedrock of Isla’s world: the crisp, honeyed purple of sun-warmed heather, and beneath it, the deep, oily, comforting tang of lanolin from the raw wool her mother was always carding. It was the smell of safety. It was the smell of *her*.

Isla reached for it now. She needed it as the anchor for this thread, the emotional truth that would turn coloured wool into a lived moment on the loom.

There was nothing.

Not a blank space, not a void. It was worse. It was a smooth, polished wall where a door had always been. The memory of the event was intact—the scraped knee, the apron, the kiss, the words. But the sensory soul of it, the scent that had been the very key to the memory’s vault, was gone. Eradicated. It was like reading a meticulous, clinical description of a symphony. All the notes were listed, in order, with their correct durations. But the music itself was absent.

A cold, formless dread began to pool in Isla’s stomach. She set the shuttle down carefully on the warp, its click against the wood abnormally loud. She tried another memory. Baking bannocks with her mother, flour dusting the table like first snow. The scent of the griddle, the hot, nutty smell of the oats toasting… gone. Only the visual remained, a silent film.

Another. Her mother brushing her hair before the fire, the rhythmic pull of the bristles, the static crackle, the smell of the peat smoke in her mother’s woolen dress… gone.

She stood up, her legs unsteady. She walked to the small, high window of the bothy and pressed her forehead against the cool glass. She was not forgetting. She was being *unmade*. Piece by piece. The Curator was no longer arguing with her story. She was editing the source material. She was going back into the archives of Isla’s life and burning the original documents, leaving only the sterile citations.

The battle had shifted. It was no longer about strength of will, or complexity of pattern. It was about ontology. What was a self, if not a cumulative library of sensory impressions, emotional echoes, and remembered touches? A woman was a story she told herself, built on a thousand tiny, incontrovertible truths—the taste of a first kiss, the sound of a father’s laugh, the smell of a mother’s skin. Unwrite those truths, and the story had no foundation. It became fiction. It became a tapestry with beautiful, intricate patterns, woven over a warp that had quietly dissolved.

Isla understood the Curator’s move with a chilling clarity. This was the ultimate patriarchal rewrite. It was not the loud, brutal censorship of burning a book. It was the silent, insidious revision of the dictionary. Change the definitions of the words—of love, of safety, of mother—and you change every story ever told with them. You don’t need to destroy the weaver if you can dissolve the threads of her own history, making her doubt the very fabric of her being. The most effective prison was not one built around a person, but one built from the inside of her own memory.

She returned to the loom. The cloth, which moments before had felt like a triumph, now felt like a lie. A beautiful, coherent lie. If the foundational memories were being erased, what was she weaving? A fantasy? A theory? The Curator was forcing her to author a self from a place of amnesia.

Her hands trembled as she took up the shuttle again. She would not stop. Stopping was surrender. But she had to weave differently now. She had to weave *against* the erosion.

She began a new section, not with a memory, but with the *absence* of one. She used a thread of a peculiar, pale grey, the colour of fog or amnesia. She wove it in a broken, stuttering pattern, a visual representation of the gap where her mother’s scent should be. It was a negative space given positive form. It was a scar in the tapestry. She did not try to fill it with something else. She let the emptiness be the pattern. She was no longer just recording her history. She was cartographing the holes that were being shot through it.

*

In her tower, the Curator watched the pale, gaping scar appear on Isla’s tapestry. She felt a flicker of annoyance, a sharp pinprick in her glacial composure. This was not the expected response. The expected response was confusion, then disorientation, then a frantic, pathetic attempt to re-create the lost memory, which would only result in a weak, derivative facsimile—a forgery of feeling. The weaver’s cloth should have begun to look desperate, incoherent.

Instead, the girl was weaving the void itself.

The Curator looked down at her own page. The colourless ink had done its work. The word “*heather-lanolin-safety-mother*” was gone, not crossed out, but utterly excised, leaving the parchment smooth and unmarked. It was a clean, surgical deletion. Yet on the tapestry, the corresponding space was not clean. It was a ragged, acknowledged wound. The girl was refusing to accept the revised text. She was inserting a footnote of protest. She was, in essence, writing “*HERE THERE WAS SOMETHING*” over the Curator’s elegant erasure.

The Curator’s frigid smile returned, thinner now. A footnote could be deleted too. It was merely a matter of scope. She had targeted a single, potent sensory memory. A tactical strike. The weaver had responded by making a monument to the strike. Very well. If the girl wished to play at monuments, the Curator would give her ruins.

She dipped her pen again into the well of colourless ink. This time, she did not target a specific word. She drew a careful, precise line through an entire clause. A sequence of memories, a causal chain. The afternoon Isla, aged twelve, had decided she would be an academic. The spark of that decision had been a specific conversation with her father, Alasdair, in his book-crammed study. He had been explaining the etymology of the word “liminal,” his hands carving the space of the threshold in the air. The dusty, papery smell of the room, the way the late sun had caught the motes of dust, turning them to gold, the feeling of her own mind stretching to grasp a concept that felt both new and ancient—that was the clause. The Curator blotted it out.

On the loom, Isla gasped. The shuttle fell from her fingers, clattering to the flagstones. A wave of dizziness passed over her, not of illness, but of profound disorientation. She knew, intellectually, that she had a doctorate. She knew she had written a thesis. But the *why* of it, the original, emotional engine that had set her on that path, was gone. It was as if her academic self was a readymade garment she had found hanging in a closet, with no memory of having chosen it or tailored it to fit. The passion behind it was absent. The cloth in front of her, the very tapestry that was her life’s work, suddenly seemed like someone else’s project. A technical exercise.

This was the true horror. It was not the loss of a fond memory. It was the loss of *motive*. It was the severing of the thread between cause and effect in her own psyche. She was becoming a collection of outcomes with no origins.

She bent, slowly, to retrieve the shuttle. Her body felt heavy, borrowed. The lens of gender dynamics, which she had wielded as an analytical tool, was now the scalpel being used on her. Her identity as a woman, as a scholar, as a daughter—these were not innate truths, but narratives. And narratives could be edited. The Curator, the ultimate archivist, was proving that history was not written by the victors, but by the editors. And the first thing any editor in that ancient, brutal tradition did was erase the contributions of the women, or rewrite them as footnotes to the actions of men.

Isla’s fear crystallised into a cold, hard rage. It was a quiet rage, the kind that settles in the bones. She would not let her life be reduced to a palimpsest where her own truths were scrubbed away to make room for the Curator’s sterile, controlling narrative. If the Curator was deleting clauses, she would write in the margins. If the Curator was burning the library, she would become the living library.

She did not try to re-weave the lost motive for her academic life. Instead, she took a thread of a defiant, bloody crimson. She wove a new pattern, right over the grey, amnesiac patch. It was a pattern of questions. A series of angular, interrupted shapes that asked “why?” without answering. It was the visual representation of doubt, of a self interrogating its own missing foundations. It was not a restoration. It was a rebellion. She was using the loom not to recreate what was lost, but to document the act of loss itself. Her tapestry was becoming a record of the siege.

*

The Curator observed the crimson questions bloom on the page. Her annoyance solidified into a cold, professional respect. The girl had spirit. She was not merely enduring the unwriting; she was annotating it. She was turning her own disintegration into a subject of study. This was… unprecedented. And dangerous.

The dialogue had become a vicious cycle. The Curator erased. Isla wove the erasure. The Curator’s act of control became the very subject matter of Isla’s resistance. The more the Curator tried to simplify the narrative, the more complex and meta-textual Isla’s tapestry became. The weaver was no longer just telling her story. She was telling the story of her story being stolen. She had internalised the lens, turned it inward, and was now weaving the dynamics of the power struggle itself.

This could not be allowed. A story about a struggle for narrative control was still a story with two authors. The Curator required a single author. A single will.

She placed her pen down. The well of colourless ink was half-empty. Tactical deletions were insufficient. The girl was too agile, too conceptual. She needed a strategic obliteration. Not a clause, but a chapter. Not a memory, but a foundational myth.

Every woman’s story, the Curator knew, was built upon a private mythology. A core, often unspoken, narrative about her own power, her own worth, her own body. For Isla MacLeod, the Curator surmised, that mythology was rooted in a specific, physical truth: her autonomy. Her right to her own borders. The most potent example of that would be a memory of violation, of a border crossed, and of her own successful defence of it. A memory where she said “no” and made it stick. That would be the keystone in the arch of her selfhood.

The Curator’s knowledge was not omniscient; it was inferential, drawn from the patterns of the tapestry itself. She saw the themes of liminality, of gendered cartography, of the defence of soft borders against hard invasions. She searched the pages of Isla’s life for a memory that functioned as the ur-text for these themes.

She found it. A memory from Isla’s late teens. A walk home on a winter’s evening in Glasgow. A man, a shadow with hands and breath. A threat that condensed out of the fog. And Isla, not with a scream, but with a cold, precise fury. A knee, a crack, a curse fading into the damp night. Not a victim’s story. A sovereign’s. A story where her body was not a petition to be granted safety, but a territory with defended borders. The memory was laced with the metallic taste of fear, the burning in her lungs, and the subsequent, fierce, glowing certainty: *This is mine. You cannot have it.*

That was the myth. That was the chapter title: *The Sovereignty of the Self*.

The Curator took up her pen. She did not dip it into the colourless ink. She plunged the entire well over the page, onto that chapter. She would not just erase the words. She would dissolve the parchment they were written on. She would un-write the event so completely that its absence would not even be a scar; it would be a smooth, unbroken continuity of a life that had never known such a threat, and therefore had never needed to discover that particular flavour of power. A life that was softer, more pliable, more *authored*.

In the bothy, Isla was weaving the crimson questions when the world dropped out from under her.

It was not a dizziness. It was a cessation. A fundamental re-ordering of gravity. She slumped forward, her hands catching the frame of the loom to keep from falling. A vast, quiet nothingness opened up inside her. It wasn't a gap. It was a new landscape.

She looked at her own hands, gripping the wood. They were her hands. But the history in them was different. The muscle memory of a certain kind of flight, of a certain kind of fight, was gone. The subtle, permanent awareness that lived in the shoulders of women who walk alone at night—the low-grade radar, the calculated risk—it had vanished. In its place was a… neutrality. A strange, unearned peace. She felt lighter, but it was the terrifying lightness of a boat cut from its anchor, drifting into open sea.

She tried to conjure the memory. The winter fog, the footsteps, the shape in the dark. It was not that she couldn’t remember it. It was that the memory had no emotional or somatic resonance. It was a dry fact, like a date from a history textbook about someone else’s war. The fear, the adrenaline, the triumphant fury—all were gone. The event was archived, but its meaning was deleted.

And with it, something else faded. The driving urgency behind her thesis, her obsession with liminal spaces and safe passage. Why had she cared so much about borders? She couldn’t quite recall. It seemed an abstract, intellectual concern. The fire in her work, the personal, political fury that had fuelled it, was extinguished. Her tapestry, which moments ago had been a record of defiant resistance, now looked like a complex, but ultimately decorative, academic exercise.

This was the seed of destruction, planted deep in the fertile dark of the “all seems lost.” The Curator had not taken her strength. She had taken the *reason* for her strength. She had not made Isla weak. She had made her… *reasonable*. Unmotivated. She had edited out the foundational trauma that had forged her will, and in doing so, had softened the metal of her character. Isla sat before her life’s work and felt a profound, chilling apathy. What was the point of this beautiful, intricate cloth? Who was it for?

The hook for the final chapter was not in a looming threat or a gathering storm. It was in the quiet, empty hearth of Isla’s own spirit. It was in the way she looked at the shuttle in her hand, not as a weapon or a voice, but as a simple, pointless tool. The Curator had won the war for the past. She had rewritten Isla’s origins. Now, Isla had to face the ultimate question: can a self, stripped of the myth that forged it, find a new reason to fight? Can a woman, her history edited into placidity, rediscover a voice that is not a reaction to violation, but a creation born of something else? The battle was over. The war of will was beginning. And Isla MacLeod had just been disarmed of her deepest, most personal *why*.

# Chapter 24

## **CHAPTER 24**

The whisky was a peat-bog ghost, haunting the glass. Isla MacLeod held it up to the weak Glasgow light bleeding through the pub window, watching the amber liquid cling to the sides like a confession. It was ten in the morning. The pub, *The Hanged Man*, smelled of last night’s spilled lager and this morning’s despair, a perfume she was coming to know intimately.

She set the glass down, untouched. The ritual, once a defiant communion with her own sharp edges, felt like a borrowed gesture. A line from a play she no longer remembered the plot to.

“He’s late,” she said, to no one.

“He’s a concept, hen,” Morag replied from behind the bar, polishing a pint glass with a cloth that had seen more battles than the standard at Culloden. “Concepts are never late. They just are, or they aren’t.” Morag was seventy if she was a day, her hair a vibrant, improbable aubergine, her arms a roadmap of faded blue tattoos. She ran *The Hanged Man* with the serene brutality of a pirate queen overseeing a derelict ship. Her eyes, the colour of old slate, scraped over Isla. “You look… tidy.”

It was an accusation. Isla *was* tidy. Her hair was pulled back in a simple, efficient knot. Her clothes—dark trousers, a grey jumper—were clean, unadorned. She looked like a competent archivist, a woman who filed her own rage in alphabetical order. The tapestry, rolled and sealed in a protective tube, leaned against the scarred wood of the booth like an umbrella. A tool for weather. Not a weapon. Not a voice.

Her concept was Professor Alistair Finch. Emeritus Chair of Comparative Metaphysics, University of Glasgow. Author of *The Architecture of Unseen Bridges: A Treatise on Interstitial Realities*. He had written her a letter on thick, cream paper that felt like pressed bone. *Your thesis on the gendered cartography of liminal spaces in Scottish folklore shows a promising, if undisciplined, mind. The Hanged Man, Tuesday, 10 a.m. Do not be late.* The letter was months old, a relic from a self who had cared about such summons. The Isla who had received it had been a creature of furious purpose, her mind a loom of urgent threads. That Isla was gone. In her place was this reasonable woman, who had come here today not out of passion, but because she had, in her new and placid state, simply forgotten to cancel.

The door opened, swallowing a wedge of damp, grey street. The man who entered was a collection of angles wrapped in a tweed overcoat several sizes too large. Professor Alistair Finch had the look of a heron that had been stuffed by a taxidermist with a grudge. His glasses were small, round, and perched on the end of a blade of a nose. He scanned the pub as if it were a disappointing archaeological dig.

His gaze landed on her. He did not smile. He navigated the tables and arrived at her booth, shedding his coat to reveal a cardigan patched at the elbows with leather. He did not sit. He looked at the whisky glass, then at her face.

“You’re not drinking it,” he said. His voice was dry, precise, a scalpel on a tray.

“No,” Isla said.

“Good. It’s swill. Morag! A pot of the Lapsang. The stuff in the black tin, not the floor-sweepings you serve to tourists.” He slid into the booth opposite her, his movements brittle. His eyes, magnified by the lenses, were a pale, watery blue. They fixed on the tube. “That’s it, I presume. The famous tapestry.”

“It is.”

“A textile thesis. A feminine argument.” He said it not with disdain, but with the flat curiosity of a linguist examining an unfamiliar declension. “You proposed that the liminal—the betwixt and between—is not a neutral wilderness, but a space historically gendered female. A space to be traversed, exploited, or feared by the male journeyer. A space where women are either guides, monsters, or the very path itself. Never the authors of the map.”

Isla felt a faint, distant echo. A vibration in a hollow place. “Yes.”

“And you used the folkloric record—the *caoineag*, the washer at the ford, the Queen of Elphame’s shifting roads—to argue that women’s magic, women’s power, has been systematically relegated to these interstitial zones. A containment strategy. Keep the unpredictable forces in the corridors, not the halls of power.”

“Yes.” The words were correct, but they felt recited. They had no heat.

Finch leaned back, steepling his fingers. They were long, stained with old ink. “A compelling thesis. Flawed, but compelling. Your flaw was one of foundation. You assumed the gendered dynamic was the primary architecture. It is not. It is a later renovation. A terrible, gaudy wallpaper pasted over the original stone.”

Morag thumped a small teapot and two china cups on the table. The tea inside smelled of smoke and damp earth. Finch poured, his movements economical. He pushed a cup toward Isla.

“The primary architecture,” he continued, “is about *ownership*. Not of space, but of narrative. Of myth. The most profound violence is not to push someone into the corridor. It is to edit the reason they walked into it in the first place. To take the wound that made them a warrior and recast it as a minor scrape. A warrior without their foundational wound is just a person holding a sword. Eventually, they put it down. They become… reasonable.”

Isla’s hand, reaching for the teacup, stilled. The air in the pub thickened. The scent of smoke and earth became the scent of a void, of archival dust. She looked at Finch, truly looked. His eyes were not old. They were *ancient*. They held a familiar, chilling patience.

“You,” Isla breathed. The word had no fear in it. It was an identification.

“A aspect. A projection,” Finch said, sipping his tea. “The Curator is a role, not a single entity. A function of the Archive. I am one of its librarians. You met my… colleague. The one who prefers a more direct editorial hand.”

“The woman in the void.”

“Indeed. She deals in erasure. I deal in… context.” He gestured to the tapestry tube. “Your work, as it was, was a splinter in the Archive’s flesh. A narrative of resistance growing from a specific, traumatic root. It was dissonant. My colleague sought to remove the root. A crude but effective surgery. She left you… tidy.” He said the word with Morag’s inflection. “But a story, even a pacified one, still exists. It can be refiled. Given a new, harmless context. That is my task.”

Isla felt nothing but a cold, crystalline clarity. The emptiness inside her was no longer a void; it was a clean, well-lit room. And in it, she saw the shape of the trap with perfect, dispassionate vision. “You’re here to give me a new *why*.”

“An *instead-of*,” Finch corrected. “A noble, scholarly *instead-of*. Your thesis, stripped of its personal fury, is merely an interesting academic footnote. I am here to offer you a position. A research fellowship. A quiet life of cataloguing, not creating. You would be an expert on liminal spaces, not a resident of them. You would be respected. Reasonable. The tapestry would be a curious early work, a phase. The fire in it would be read as youthful exuberance, not a core truth.” He smiled, a thin crack in parchment. “It is a kinder fate than oblivion. Most never get an *instead-of*. They simply get a *never-was*.”

He was right. It was kind. It was the peace she had pretended to want in her darkest hours. A world where her pain was not a forge, but a footnote. A life where her gender was a category of study, not a lived battlefield. She could put down the shuttle. She could stop being a needle, piercing through layer after layer of meaning. She could be a thread, lying smooth and untroubled in the weave.

She looked at the tapestry tube. The Isla who had woven it was gone. That woman’s reason—the searing, personal violation that had made borders a life-or-death concern—was a dry fact in a deleted file. That warrior was dismantled.

But the tapestry itself remained. It was evidence of a *process*, not just a product. It was a record of a hand moving, a choice following a choice, a colour placed beside another colour. It was a thing *made*.

Finch was watching her, reading her face like a text. “There is no shame in it, Ms. MacLeod. The greatest human freedom is the freedom to re-interpret one’s own past. We are offering you that freedom. Your new chapter writes itself. A quiet study, a respected career. No more monsters. No more thresholds. Just… pleasant, intellectual order.”

Isla’s fingers touched the cool porcelain of the teacup. She thought of Morag’s tattoos, a roadmap of choices etched into skin. She thought of her own skin, unmarked. She thought of the shuttle in her hand, feeling like a pointless tool.

Then she thought of the tool itself. Not as an extension of a reason, but as an object with heft and shape. A thing that could be held, regardless of why.

“The freedom to re-interpret,” she said, her voice quiet in the pub’s gloom. “Is that what you call it?”

“It is a profound gift.”

“A gift you give,” she said. “Which means it’s a gift you can take away. That’s not freedom. That’s curation.”

For the first time, a flicker of something other than detached interest crossed Finch’s face. Impatience. “Semantics. The outcome is peace.”

Isla looked past him, to Morag behind the bar. The pirate queen was polishing the same glass, her expression one of profound boredom. But her eyes, when they flicked to Isla, held a glint. A challenge. *Concepts are never late. They just are, or they aren’t.*

Isla’s concept of herself was gone. Edited. What was left?

The hand. The tool. The cloth.

She unrolled the tapestry on the table, pushing the teacups aside. Finch made a small, irritated sound. The vibrant, chaotic landscape of threads spilled out—the bloody ford, the dark forest paths, the queen’s road stitched in silver and shadow. It was beautiful. It was meaningless to her now.

“You see?” Finch said softly. “It’s just a thing. A complex, decorative thing. The passion is archived. Let it be. Let *yourself* be.”

Isla ran her fingers over the surface. She felt the ridges of thread, the variations in texture. She came to the final panel, the one she had been working on when the void had taken her. It was unfinished. It showed the entrance to a cave, the threshold suggested by a mere hint of darker wool. It was an opening. A mouth. A beginning with no clear end.

Her fingers traced the cave’s suggested outline. And she remembered something. Not the memory itself, but the *feeling* of the memory’s shape. The hollow where the fear had been. It was a specific hollow. It had contours.

She looked at Finch. “You took the *why*. You took the fuel. But you left me the loom.”

“A loom is inert without a weaver with a design,” he said.

“Is it?” Isla asked. The question was genuine. She was not arguing from passion. She was observing from the clean, well-lit room. “What if the design isn’t the point? What if the point is the *weaving*?”

Finch blinked. The concept, as he understood it, did not compute.

Isla picked up the tapestry. She did not look at the images. She felt the weight of it. The sheer, physical *fact* of it. Miles of thread. Hundreds of hours. A monumental act of *doing*.

The reason for the doing was gone. But the *done* remained.

And in that clean, well-lit room of her self, a new question formed. It was not a fiery *why*. It was a calm, practical *how*.

How does a woman move, when her pain is no longer her engine?

She stood up, rolling the tapestry with slow, deliberate care. Finch watched her, his head tilted.

“The fellowship,” he said. “The offer stands. But only now. Walk out that door with that cloth, and you walk into the wilderness. A wilderness you no longer have the rage to navigate. You will be lost. Not heroically. Just… pointlessly.”

Isla slid the tapestry back into its tube. She fastened the cap. She looked at the untouched whisky, the steaming tea. She looked at Morag, who gave her the faintest, most imperceptible nod—the nod of a queen seeing a sailor finally glance at the stars, not the storm.

“I’m already lost,” Isla said. Her voice was calm. Reasonable, even. “My map was deleted. But I still have my feet.”

She walked out of *The Hanged Man*. The damp Glasgow air wrapped around her, smelling of diesel and distant rain. She stood on the pavement, the tube under her arm. The city moved around her—people with purposes, with reasons, with fires banked or blazing.

She had none. She was a vessel swept clean. A loom, empty.

But a loom has a structure. A vessel has a shape.

She began to walk. Not toward the university. Not toward home. She walked without destination. She observed the thresholds she passed: the door of a close, the gap between two buildings, the bridge over the murky Kelvin. They were just architectural features. They held no terror, no magic. They were… spaces.

And as she walked, she paid attention to her body. The swing of her arms. The solid strike of her boots on the pavement. The weight of the tube in her grip. She paid attention to the act of moving through space. The simple, physical fact of traversal.

She walked for hours. The sky darkened prematurely, the Glasgow gloom thickening into drizzle. She found herself on the banks of the Clyde, watching the water, the colour of cold slate, slide past. It was a threshold, too. A moving line between here and there.

Her hand went to the tube. She uncapped it, pulled out a foot of the tapestry. She looked at the unfinished cave. An opening.

From her pocket, she took her small sewing kit. A needle, a few basic threads. She did not have her proper materials. She had the wrong colours. It didn’t matter.

She sat on a damp bench, the tapestry across her knees. The drizzle beaded on the wool. She threaded a needle with a length of ordinary, grey cotton. She did not think about meaning. She did not think about resistance or gender or ownership of narrative. She thought about the next stitch.

Her needle pierced the cloth near the cave mouth. She pulled the grey thread through. It was a neutral colour. A colour of fog, of uncertainty. She made another stitch. And another.

She was not weaving a story of trauma. She was not weaving a story at all. She was simply weaving. The hand moved. The thread followed. The cave’s outline began to extend, not with dramatic shadow, but with a suggestion of depth in simple, unremarkable grey.

This was not a reaction. It was not a defiance born of a wound. It was something quieter, more fundamental. It was an assertion of presence. *I am here. My hand moves. Therefore, I continue.*

The Curator had taken the myth that forged her. She could not reclaim it; it was gone, a fossil in someone else’s archive. So she would not try. She would not search for a new, grand reason. A new trauma to define her. A new banner to wave.

She would be defined by the act, not the cause. By the making, not the meaning imposed upon it.

The drizzle soaked into her hair, her jumper. She kept stitching. The grey thread built the cave’s depth, stitch by mundane stitch. It was not beautiful. It was not powerful. It was just a thing being done.

And in the doing, a faint warmth began to kindle. Not the roaring fire of old fury, but the low, steady heat of metabolism. Of a body alive and in motion. It was not a reason. It was a *condition*.

She was not a warrior reclaiming her sword. She was a woman, sitting in the rain, sewing. And that, in its utter simplicity, was a territory the Curator had not thought to claim. They had archived the grand narratives of pain and triumph. They had no category for this quiet, persistent *doing*.

A figure approached along the river path. Not Finch. A woman, younger, her coat pulled tight against the damp. She paused, looking at Isla on the bench, stitching in the rain.

“You’ll ruin it,” the woman said, her voice friendly, concerned.

Isla looked up. She looked at the stranger, then down at the tapestry. The vibrant, old work, and the new, plain grey growth emerging from it.

“No,” Isla said, her voice calm. Certain in a way that had nothing to do with reason. “I’m just adding to it.”

The woman smiled, shrugged, and walked on.

Isla watched her go. Then she looked back at her hands. At the needle. At the cloth.

The battle of the past was over. She had lost. The war of will was not about reclaiming what was taken. It was about discovering what could be built on the empty ground that remained.

She was not weaving a new myth. She was weaving the next stitch. And the one after that.

And that, she realized as the grey thread pulled through the linen, was a kind of power no archive could ever catalogue. It was the power of the hand that moves, not because the story demands it, but because it is what hands do. It was a creation born of nothing more, and nothing less, than her own ongoing presence in the world.

The hook for the final chapter was not in a victory, or a reckoning. It was in the next stitch. And the one after that. It was in the quiet, relentless fact of a woman, disarmed of every reason, choosing—simply, physically—to continue. The tapestry would grow, in plain, unheroic grey. And she would grow with it, not from a wound, but from a motion. The ultimate expression of the gendered dynamic was not to transcend it, but to render it irrelevant. To become, finally, neither guide nor monster nor path, but simply the hand that holds the needle. The self, as verb.
